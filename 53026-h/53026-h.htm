<h2>Preface</h2>

<p>A critical reader of the works of Darwin, Huxley,
Spencer, Haeckel, Romanes, Weismann, Mivart, Cope
and other writers, on organic evolution, will find that
there is much diversity in the views of these writers.
Darwin believes that the first one, or the first few,
animals and plants were directly and specially made
by the Creator; Haeckel says the primordial forms
arose “by spontaneous generation from inorganic matter.”
Referring to the origin of life, Romanes says that
“science is not in a position to furnish so much as
suggestion upon the subject.” Neither Huxley, Weismann,
Mivart nor Cape has anything to say on the
origin of life. No two of these writers agree as to the
work of the “factors” of evolution. According to
Darwin, Romanes and Weismann, natural selection
did substantially the entire work of evolving all the
species of animal and plant. But Cope, and other
evolutionists of the Lamarckian school, hold that use,
disuse, pressure, friction and motion did it.</p>

<p>Weismann argues that the inheritance of “acquired
characters” is impossible; while Spencer, Romanes
and other evolutionists say that Weismann’s
views are highly absurd and would entirely destroy
the theory of evolution; and I think they are correct
in this view. There are many evolutionists for and
against Weismann’s theory of heredity. Writers on
evolution differ as widely on other important questions,
as on these.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Many of the theories of the evolutionists are quite
absurd. Among these may be mentioned the theory
of “protective mimicry” and “sexual selection.” So
their belief that the blind “factors,” working by chance
and accident, have differentiated one part of a minute
individual into a set of male sexual organs, and another
part of the same individual into a set of female
sexual organs, as in hermaphroditic animals and
plants, appears to be quite preposterous. So it is impossible
to believe these “factors” have differentiated
one-half of the individuals of each species of mammal
into males and the other half into females, for
example into men and women. If time and space permitted
me, I could easily point out divers other absurdities
in the views of the evolutionists.</p>

<p>To be consistent, every evolutionist must maintain
that characters, acquired by the parent, are transmitted
by heredity to their offspring; for the whole
theory of evolution is based on the hypothesis of accumulated
“adaptations and variations.” Thus, suppose
a pair of snakes have ten vertebræ (joints) in
their spinal columns; that each of them acquires one,
making eleven; that their offspring start with eleven
and acquire one, and so on until the ninetieth generation,
which would have a hundred vertebræ. Such
a thing might happen, according to the evolutionist;
but I do not believe any such thing ever did happen.</p>

<p>But no evolutionist has ever shown how or why
the offspring happen to resemble one or both of their
parents. In brief, the mechanism of heredity is wholly
unknown. The evolutionist tells us that “heredity
and adaptation” have evolved all the species of animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and plant. Having done this, he appears to
think that he has explained all the phenomena of
reproduction, heredity and life. But his solution of
the vital equation contains an unknown quantity,
namely: “heredity;” and it is, therefore, no solution
at all.</p>

<p>The evolutionist and materialist maintain that
the blind unthinking atoms and cells, of which the
embryo body is made, do, spontaneously and automatically,
without the aid or guidance of any extraneous,
psychic or creative force, group themselves into
the chemical combinations and mechanical arrangements,
which are necessary to build up the embryo
body with all its organs and parts&mdash;its brain, eyes,
ears, heart, lungs, etc. This is the most preposterous
of all their propositions.</p>

<p>I have worked out this proposition:</p>

<p>“Intellect, memory, will-power, force and motion
are necessary to group two or more atoms into a prescribed
chemical combination; or into a specified mechanical
arrangement.”</p>

<p>Thus, if the reader were required to group ten
silver dollars into a triangle with three dollars in
each side and one in the center, he must have intellect
to understand the nature and properties of a
triangle; and to know how to construct it; and to
know when it is completed; must have memory to
bear these things in mind while doing the work; must
have will-power to begin and continue the work until
it is completed; must generate such force and produce
such motions as are necessary to assemble and
group the coins into the prescribed figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Can the reader discover any flaw in this proposition?</p>

<p>There is no trace of the coming embryo in the
germ-cell (fertilized ovum); nor of any organ or part
of it. It follows that each embryo and every organ
and part of it must be made, anew, of fresh materials;
that the atoms and cells of which it is composed must
be selected, assembled and grouped into the chemical
combinations and mechanical arrangements which are
necessary to construct the embryo body and each organ
and part of it; each organ and part of it being
a new combination of its component atoms and cells.</p>

<p>Intellect, memory, will-power, force and motion&mdash;supernatural,
psychic and creative force&mdash;are necessary
to make each embryo body and every organ and
part of it. Let us suppose that a hundred million silver
dollars were coined last year, at the mint in
Philadelphia. It is clear that each of these coins was
made, anew; that it was a new combination of the
atoms of silver and copper contained in it; that it required
the same work to make each of them, that it
did to make every other&mdash;the same to make the last
that it did to make the first. The same is true of each
man and woman.</p>

<p>The purpose of this little work is to present some
of the facts, and make some of the arguments, which
tend to prove that each human being is a new, direct
and special creation by Almighty God!</p>

<h2 id="sec1">Sec. 1. Personal God</h2>

<p>I believe there is a personal God, the Creator and
Ruler of the Universe. If this is not true, matter,
force and the motion of matter constitute the Universe.
There is no middle ground between these two propositions.</p>

<p>The first animal that ever lived on our earth was
directly and specially made by the Creator; or it
arose by spontaneous generation from inorganic matter.
How else could it come into existence? The
same is true of the first plant. Which of these two
theories is most reasonable?</p>

<p>Every human being that ever lived was either
directly and specially made by the Creator; or the
blind unthinking atoms and cells of which his body
was, and is, composed, spontaneously and automatically
grouped themselves into the chemical combinations
and mechanical arrangements necessary to build
up his body. How else could a human body be made?
Which hypothesis is most plausible?</p>

<p>Can we believe that intellect, memory and will
are merely properties of matter, like length, breadth,
thickness and weight; or are these faculties the attributes
of a spiritual entity?</p>

<p>I believe that the Creator has been manifesting
His knowledge, wisdom, power and goodness ever
since the first man appeared on the earth; that He
has been performing miracles before the eyes of men
during all this time; that He has been speaking to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
mankind through these manifestations and miracles
throughout the ages. But they have failed to read
His messages.</p>

<p>Most educated persons are familiar with the
phenomena of life, reproduction and heredity. But
the real question is: whether the Creator causes these
phenomena, or whether the blind, unthinking atoms
and cells, of which the body is composed, produce
them, spontaneously and automatically, without the
aid of any extraneous psychic or creative force. The
fact that these phenomena are manifested, and the
cause of them, are two wholly different things. Everybody
knows that a stone falls to the ground, but
nobody knows why.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec2">Sec. 2. Whence and Whither</h2>

<p>Has man descended from worms, fishes, lizards,
opossums, hedgehogs and apes as Haeckel says? Is
he a son of an ape? No! A Son of God!</p>

<p>Does death annihilate both soul and body; or
does the soul live after the death of the body? Shall
we see and know our children, fathers, mothers,
brothers, sisters, husbands, wives, and friends after
death? Shall we enjoy forever, the society of the
good, the true and the beautiful? Shall we be free
from want, pain and sorrow? Shall we be happy
throughout eternity? This is my belief and hope!</p>

<p>Darwin (Origin of Species, vol. 1, p. 228) says:
“Have we any right to suppose that the Creator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
works by intellectual powers like those of man?” On
the same page he refers to “the works of the Creator”
as being superior to those of man. In the same work
(vol. 2, p. 304) he refers to “the laws impressed on
matter by the Creator.” Again (p. 306) he refers
to life as “having been originally breathed by the
Creator into a few forms or into one,” animal, at the
beginning of life on the earth. In his Descent of Man
(p. 95) he says: “There is no evidence that man was
aboriginally endowed with the ennobling belief in
the existence of the omnipotent God.” Referring to
the question: “Whether there exists a Creator and
Ruler of the Universe.” On the same page he says:
“And this has been answered in the affirmative by
some of the highest intellects that have ever existed.”
In the same work (p. 627) he says: “The idea of
a universal and beneficent Creator does not seem to
arise in the mind of man, until he has been elevated
by long continued culture.” On the same page he
says: “Few persons feel any anxiety from the impossibility
of determining at what precise period, in
the development of the individual, from the first trace
of a minute germinal vesicle, man becomes an immortal
being.” Again (pp. 627-628) he says: “The
birth, both of the species and of the individual are
equally parts of that grand sequence of events which
our minds refuse to accept as the result of blind
chance. The understanding revolts at such a conclusion.”
Thus it appears that Darwin believed in the
existence of a personal God and in the immortality
of the human soul. But he also believed
“that the production and extinction of the past and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
present inhabitants of the world” have been “due
to secondary causes, like these determining the birth
and death of the individual.” (Origin of Species,
2, p. 304.) In brief, Darwin maintained that the
Creator directly and specially made one or a few
primordial forms, and turned them loose upon the
earth to shift for themselves, subject to the “factors
of evolution.”</p>

<p>Although Darwin appears to believe in the special
creation of the first one, or the first few, animals
and plants, and in the immortality of the human soul,
yet his theory of evolution is highly materialistic; and
the publication of this Origin of Species gave materialism
an immense impetus.</p>

<p>The Encyclopedia Britannica (9 ed., vol. 2, p.
109), referring to “thinkers, who hold materialistic
views,” says:</p>

<p>“According to this school, man is a machine,
no doubt the most complex and wonderfully adapted
of all known machines, but still neither more nor loss
than an instrument whose energy is provided by force
from without, and which, when set in action performs
the various operations, for which its structure fits it,
namely: to live, move, feel and think.”</p>

<p>The materialist maintains that there is no substance
in man, which is alone conscious, distinct and
separable from the body; that matter is the only substance
in existence; and that matter and its motions
constitute the universe. (Cent. Dic. 5, p. 3658.) This
work, on the same page quotes J. Fisk (Evolutionist,
p. 277) as saying that “Philosophical materialism
holds that matter, and the motions of matter, make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
up the sum total of existence; and that what we know
as psychical phenomena in man and other animals,
are to be interpreted, in an ultimate analysis as simply
the peculiar aspect, which is assumed by certain
enormously complicated motions of matter.” (Cent.
Dic. 5, p. 3658)</p>

<p>According to this view, if one should meet a
friend, the sight of him would set certain atoms in
his eyes and brain in motion; and these atoms would
inform the Ego that the man is his friend, Smith or
Jones.</p>

<p>So, if one be required to find the square root
of 3,600, his eyes or ears would see or hear the problem;
and the sight or hearing of it would set certain
atoms in motion; and by this motion they would
ascertain that 60 is the square root required. But
the theory is too absurd for discussion, in this place.</p>

<p>I assume that every evolutionist is logically a
materialist. Referring to “Man and the rest of the
living world,” Huxley, (Man’s Place, etc., p. 151),
says:</p>

<p>“I can see no excuse for doubting that all are
co-ordinated terms of nature’s great progression, from
the formless to the formed&mdash;from the inorganic to the
organic&mdash;from the blind force to conscious intellect
and will.”</p>

<p>So far as I know he does not mention the Creator
nor the human soul in any of his works; but he strenuously
maintains that man is a son of an ape; and
believes that all the phenomena of life are the result
of chemical and mechanical forces.</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer does not use the word “God,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
“Creator” nor “Soul” in the index to his Principles
of Biology; but after discussing the theory of special
creation at length, he says:</p>

<p>“The hypothesis of special creation turns out to
be worthless by its derivation; worthless in its incoherence;
absolutely without evidence; worthless as
not supplying an intellectual need, worthless as not
supplying a moral want.” (Principles of Biology 1,
p. 430.)</p>

<p>This quotation is full of bosh and nonsense. For
example: In the same book (pp. 415-416), referring
to the hypothesis of special creation and to that of
evolution, Spencer says:</p>

<p>“Both hypotheses imply a cause. The last, certainly
as much as the first, recognizes this cause as
<i>inscrutable</i>. The point at issue is, how this inscrutable
cause has worked, in the production of living
forms. This point, if it is to be decided at all, is to
be decided only by examination of evidence.”</p>

<p>The word “inscrutable” is synonymous with
“impenetrable,” “undiscoverable,” “incomprehensible,”
“unsearchable,” “mysterious.” (Cent. Dic. 4,
p. 3114.)</p>

<p>Now, if the Cause which produces animals and
plants is impenetrable, incomprehensible, etc., Spencer
could not possibly know whether each animal and
plant is directly and specially made by the Creator
or not; nor could he say, logically, that there is no
evidence of special creation; for he admits that the
Cause is “inscrutable” to him. But there is abundant
evidence that each animal and plant is a new
direct and special creation, for the obvious reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
that no other hypothesis can explain and account for
the admitted facts.</p>

<p>Haeckel, (Evolution of Man, p. 26), says the first
one, or the first few, animals that appeared on our
earth arose “by spontaneous generation from inorganic
matter.” On the same page he says:</p>

<p>“Life is only a physical phenomenon. All the
plants and animals, with man at their head, are to be
explained in structure and life, by mechanical or efficient
causes, without any appeal to final causes, just
as in the case of minerals and other inorganic bodies.
This applies equally to the origin of the various
species. We must not assume any original creation
… to explain this, but a natural, continuous
and necessary evolution.”</p>

<p>Prior to the publication of Darwin’s Origin of
Species in 1859, belief in the theory of special creation
was well nigh universal among scientists as well as
laymen. But immediately after the publication of
that work the scientific world accepted Darwin’s
theory as absolute truth, not only as to animals and
plants, but extended the Darwinian principle of materialism
to all other branches of science. Materialism
permeated all literature and became a fad. It fostered
“higher criticism,” agnosticism, infidelity and atheism.
It destroyed human hope and enthroned despair.
It shook and rent the church from the corner stone to
the spire.</p>

<p>According to the materialist, there is no such
thing as a personal God, nor a human soul. He maintains
that life, intellect, memory and will-power are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
mere properties of the human body as a physical
structure; and that death works the absolute annihilation
of the body and the Ego. In his view, there is
no life, punishment nor pleasure after death. He,
therefore, resolves to make the most of his life, and
to get all the ease, comfort and pleasure that it affords,
without regard to anything that may happen after
death. He has no fear of any final judgment, nor of
God. He is not restrained by any moral law, nor by
any religious obligation. He fears nothing but publicity,
public opinion, and the criminal statutes. Hence,
lying, cheating, fraud, perjury, theft, robbery, murder,
suicide.</p>

<p>I admit that heredity, environment and other
forces, which the evolutionist denominates, “the factors
of organic evolution,” may affect, modify, or
differentiate an animal or a plant, or its organs and
parts, to a certain extent. But I deny that heredity,
environment or any, or all, the “factors” combined,
are adequate to evolve a new species of animal or
plant; or even a new organ or part of one. On the
contrary I maintain that heredity, environment and
all other factors of evolution combined, are inadequate
to produce a single animal or plant, without the aid
of the Creator; and that each animal and plant is a
new, direct and special creation by Almighty God.</p>

<p>In this little work, I shall make an humble effort
to prove that there is a living personal God; that He
directly and specially creates each human being;
makes its body and endows it with life and with an
immortal soul. If the reader shall think that I have
made a creditable effort to accomplish this purpose, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
shall have done my fellow man a good service by
pointing the way to hope and happiness.</p>

<h2 id="sec3">Sec. 3. Chemical Elements Composing the
Human Body</h2>

<p>“Of the elements known to chemists,” says Professor
Martin, “only sixteen have been found to take
part in the formation of the human body. These are
(1) calcium, (2) carbon, (3) chlorine, (4) fluorine,
(5) hydrogen, (6) iron, (7) lithium, (8) magnesium,
(9) manganese, (10) nitrogen, (11) oxygen, (12)
phosphorus, (13) potassium, (14) silicon, (15) sodium,
and (16) sulphur. Copper and lead have sometimes
been found in small quantities, but are probably
accidental and occasional.” (Martin, Human Body,
p. 7.)</p>

<p>It is clear that neither the nature nor the properties
of these elementary substances, are changed by
the fact that such substance has become a part of the
body. For example, iron is iron whether in or out of
the body.</p>

<p>It is probable that the chemical composition of
the human body is substantially the same as that of
the body of every other mammal.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="sec4">Sec. 4. Atoms</h2>

<p>The words “atom” and “atoms” will be often
used in the following pages. Therefore, it is deemed
proper to state the nature and properties of an atom,
so far as known. It is defined as: “An extremely minute
particle of matter; a hypothetical particle of matter,
so minute as to admit of no division; an ultimate
indivisible particle of matter. (Cent. Dic. 1, p. 365.)
The Encyclopedia Britannica says: “Atom is a body
which cannot be cut in two. The Atomic theory is a theory
of the constitution of bodies, which asserts that they
are made up of atoms.” (Encyc. Brit. 3, p. 36.) A
molecule is the smallest mass of any substance, which
is capable of existing in a separate form; that is the
smallest part, into which the substance can be divided
without destroying its chemical identity. A molecule
of any substance is conceived of as made up of two
or more atoms. (Cent. Dic. 5, p. 3822.)</p>

<p>In biology a cell is defined, first, as the fundamental
form-element of every organized body. Secondly,
as a nucleated, capsulated form element of any
structure or tissue; one of the protoplasmic bodies,
which build up an animal fabric; a body consisting
of cell-substance, cell-wall and cell-nucleus, as bone-cell,
etc. (Cent. Dic. 1, p. 878.) The body of every
animal and plant is made of cells; and each cell is
composed of many atoms.</p>

<h2 id="sec5">Sec. 5. Cells and Cell Theory</h2>

<p>In Biology, the word “cell” denotes the fundamental
form-element of every organized body. It
is a bioplastic mass of protoplasm, varying in size and
shape, generally of microscopic dimensions, capable,
under proper conditions, of performing the functions
of sensation, nutrition, reproduction and automatic or
spontaneous motion, and constituting in itself an entire
organism, or being capable of entering into the
structure of one.</p>

<p>Such a cell, as a rule, has a nucleus and is usually
also provided with a wall or definite boundary; but
neither cell-nucleus nor cell-wall necessarily enters
into its structure. In ultimate morphological analysis,
all organized tissue is resolvable into cells or cell products.
See “<a href="#sec6">Protoplasm</a>,” and “<a href="#sec5">Cell Theory</a>,” infra.</p>

<p>Specifically, the word “cell” denotes a nucleated
capsulated form-element of any structure or tissue
one of the independent protoplasmic bodies which
build up an animal fabric. A body consisting of cell
substances, cell-wall and cell-nucleus, as bone cells,
cartilage-cells, muscle-cells, nerve-cells, fat-cells, cells
of connective tissue, of mucous and serous membrane,
etc., of the blood, lymph, etc. This is the usual character
of cells in animals, and is the ordinary technical
anatomical sense of the word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“However complicated one of the higher animals
or plants may be,” says Huxley, “it begins its separate
existence under the form of a nucleated cell.”&mdash;Huxley,
<i>Anatomy Invert. An. p. 19</i>.</p>

<p>See Haeckel, Ev. Man, chap. 6. “<i>Ovum and
amœba</i>,” pp. 36-50; Spencer, <i>Principles, Biology, Index,

Int. Encyc. 4</i>, p. 400.</p>

<p>Professor McMurrich, of the University of Michigan,
says:</p>

<p>“It has been estimated that the number of cells
entering into the composition of the body of an adult
human being is about twenty-six million five hundred
thousand million.” (McMurrich, <i>Development, Human
Body</i>, p. 18.) This number is equivalent to
twenty-six and a half trillions.</p>

<p>The “cell theory” is the doctrine that the bodies
of all animals and plants consist, either of a cell, or of
a number of cells, and their products; and that all
cells proceed from cells, as expressed in the phrase
<i>omnis cellula e cellula</i>: a doctrine foreshadowed by
Kasper Freidrich Wolff, who died in 1794, and by
Karl Ernst Von Baer (born 1792.) It was established
in botany by Schleiden in 1838, and in zoology by
Theodor Schwann about 1839.</p>

<p>Its complete form, including the ovum, as a simple
cell, also, is the basis of the present state of the
biological sciences.&mdash;<i>Cent. Dic. 1, p. 879, col. 1.</i></p>

<h2 id="sec6">Sec. 6. Protoplasm</h2>

<p>Protoplasm is an albuminoid substance, ordinarily
resembling the white of an egg, consisting of carbon,
oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen in extremely complex
and unstable molecular combination, and capable, under
proper conditions, of manifesting certain vital
phenomena, as spontaneous motion, sensation, assimilation,
and reproduction, thus constituting the physical
basis of life of all plants and animals; sarcode.
It is essential to the nature of protoplasm that the
substance consist chemically of the four elements
named (with or without a trace of some other elements);
but the molecule is so highly compounded that
these elements may be present in somewhat different
proportions in different cases, so that the chemical
formula is not always the same. The name has also
been somewhat loosely applied to albuminous substances
widely different in some physical properties,
as density or fluidity. Thus the hard material of so-called
vegetable ivory and the soft body of an amœba
are both protoplasmic. The physiological activities
of protoplasm are manifested in its irritability, or
ready response to external stimuli, as well as its inherent
capacity of spontaneous movement and other
indications of life; so that the least particle of this
substance may be observed to go through the whole
cycle of vital functions. Protoplasm builds up every
vegetable and animal fabric, it is itself devoid of discernible
histological structure. It is ordinarily colorless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and transparent, or nearly so, and of glairy or
viscid semi-fluid consistency, as is well seen in the
bodies of foraminifers, amœbæ, and other of the
lowest forms of animal life. Such protoplasm (originally
named sarcode) when not confined by an investing
membrane, has the power of extension in any
direction in the form of temporary processes capable
of being withdrawn again; and it has also the characteristic
property of streaming in minute masses
through closed membranes without the loss of the
identity of such masses. An individuated mass of
protoplasm, generally of microscopic size with or without
a nucleus and a wall, constitutes a cell, which may
be the whole body of an organism, or the structural
unit of aggregation of a multicellular animal or plant.
The ovum of any creature consists of protoplasm, and
all the tissues of the most complex living organisms result
from the multiplication, differentiation, and
specialization of such protoplasmic cell-units. The
life of the organism, as a whole, consists in the continuous
waste and repair of the protoplasmic material
of its cells. No animal, however, can elaborate
protoplasm directly from the chemical elements of
that substance. The manufacture of protoplasm is a
function of the vegetable kingdom. Plants make it
directly from mineral compounds and from the atmosphere
under the influence of the sun’s light and
heat, thus becoming the store-house of food-stuff for
the animal kingdom.&mdash;(See Cent. Dic. 6, p. 4799.)</p>

<p>Hence this substance, known in Vegetable Physiology
as protoplasm, but often referred to by zoölogists
as sarcode, has been appropriately designated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>

<p>For the whole living world, then, it results that
the morphological unit&mdash;the primary and fundamental
form of life&mdash;is merely an individual mass of protoplasm,
in which no further structure is discernible.&mdash;(Huxley,

<h2 id="sec7">Sec. 7. Human Body is a Compound
Physical Structure Built of Cells</h2>

<p>The human body and every organ, part and cell
in it, has length, breadth, thickness and weight, like a
brick or stone. So, every such body and every organ
and part of it is built of material substances as completely
as are the foundation, walls, roof and other
parts of a brick house. The body, as a whole, and
every organ and part of it, has every property and
attribute of a physical structure; and all the materials
of which the body is built up, except the germ-cell
(or fertilized ovum), were dead matter before
they were assimilated and incorporated into it. So,
all the materials, of which such a body is built up, are
selected, assembled, grouped together and put into
position in the body in the same manner that bricks,
or blocks of stone are gathered up and put into position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
in a building, but by different forces and other
means.</p>

<p>But there is a marked difference between the
process of building a house, engine, or other inanimate
structure, on the one hand, and the body of the human
embryo on the other. The wood, clay, iron and
other materials used in the construction of the former
are found ready to hand; and they are cut, sawed,
burned, molded, or hammered, by man, into the proper
size, form and condition for use in the construction
of the building or machine; and are carried, by him,
to the place, at which the building or machine is to
be constructed. He then places these materials in
such positions as to build up and complete the building
or machine.</p>

<p>On the other hand the materials of which the
body of the human embryo is built, are carried by
the blood of the mother to their proper places in
the body; and different portions of the same raw material,
namely: the mother’s blood, are then differentiated
and specialized into bones, muscles, nerves,
arteries, veins, and other tissues, which go to make up
the human body.</p>

<p>These bones, muscles, nerves, etc., are all new
creations, independent of those of the mother, father
or any other human being that ever lived. Except
the tiny germ-cell, which is less than one-trillionth
part of the infant, at birth, they are built of atoms
that never formed any part of any other human body.
The human body is not only a compound physical
structure, consisting of hundreds of bones, hundreds
of muscles, arteries, veins, etc., and of trillions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
cells; and of many organs, as the brain, heart, lungs,
etc., but each of its tissues and each of its organs and
parts has its own chemical composition and its own
mechanical arrangement, peculiar to itself. For
example, all the bones are composed of phosphate of
lime, carbonate of lime and other elements peculiar
to the bony tissue. Again, the atoms (cells) in each
bone are mechanically arranged in a manner peculiar
to that bone. Thus, the atoms in the bones of the
skull are so arranged as to make them flat and curved,
with an inner and outer plate; those in the other
bones are so arranged as to make them long and
cylindrical (arms and legs); others short (hands and
feet); others flat and curved (ribs); others with complex
forms (vertebræ), and so on. The muscular,
vascular and nervous tissues are each composed of
chemical elements peculiar to themselves; and their
atoms are so arranged, mechanically, as to form the
muscles, arteries, veins, nerves, etc.</p>

<p>The human body is not only a compound physical
structure, with all these tissues, organs, cells, etc., but
life is added to all the other wonderful properties,
which it possesses.</p>

<p>Now, the chemical elements, which compose the
bones, muscles, arteries, veins, nerves, etc., either assemble,
automatically, and group themselves, chemically,
and at the same time, automatically, arrange
themselves, mechanically, in such a manner as to form
the bones, muscles, arteries, veins, nerves, brain, heart,
lungs, stomach, etc., without the aid of any extraneous
psychic or creative force, or this wonderful work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
is done by the Creator, Himself. Which hypothesis
is most plausible?</p>

<p>But this is not all. Each organ and part of the
body is adjusted to, and correlated with, every other
organ and part of it. For example, the heart and
lungs are so arranged as to work together. What
force or agency selected, assembled and grouped the
chemical elements, which compose the heart, then arranged
these atoms in such a manner as to form the
heart with chambers, valves, etc.? How did it happen
that the elements, which compose the lungs, were assembled,
grouped and arranged so as to form them
with their complex machinery. Are these things the
work of blind unthinking cells or of the Creator?</p>

<p>It is inconceivable that the germ-cell (fertilized
ovum), the mother’s blood or any atom of it has intellect,
memory or will-power. It would be absurd nonsense
to suppose that the atoms, of which bones, muscles,
nerves, etc., are composed automatically, and of their
own motion, differentiated themselves into bones,
muscles, nerves, etc., and then grouped themselves
together, mechanically, in such manner as to form the
bones, muscles, nerves, etc., then fitted themselves together
as we find them in the body of the infant at
birth.</p>

<p>The properties and characteristics of the human
body, as a physical structure, are not altered nor affected
by the fact that it is composed of live tissues,
such as bones, muscles, arteries, veins, nerves, etc.,
and of live organs as the brain, heart, lungs, liver,
stomach, kidneys, etc., for the body and every organ
and part of it has the same length, breadth, thickness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and weight, whether living or dead, at least, until
disintegration sets in. In brief, the living human body
has identically the same physical properties and characteristics
that an inanimate body would have, if the
latter were composed of the same chemical elements,
combined in the same proportions and mechanically
arranged in the same manner and kept at the same
temperature, as that of the human body; and the body
merely has life, intellect, memory and will-power
added to its physical properties and characteristics.</p>

<p>Nor do the atoms and cells, nor the organs and
parts, of which the body is composed, except the
brain, have any more intellect, memory and will-power
than so many grains of sand, or so many bricks.
For example: Every man knows that neither his
bones, muscles, arteries, veins, nerves, eyes, ears, nose,
arms, hands, legs, feet, heart, lungs, stomach, liver,
nor his kidneys have any intellectual powers whatever.</p>

<p>Every man knows that the infant, at birth, has
no conscious intellect, memory, nor will-power. It
is, therefore, absurd to suppose that the embryo has
any power or control over its own development and
growth. It is equally clear that the mother has no
direct power nor control over its growth.</p>

<p>So, every man knows that his I, ego, or self has
no power, nor any control over any part of his body
except his brain and voluntary muscles. For example,
no man can determine his complexion; nor the color
of his hair; nor of his eyes; nor the length of his
nose, nor his feet; nor the size of his head. These
facts prove, conclusively, that the Creator generates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
guides and controls the forces which build up the
embryo body.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec8">Sec. 8. Human Body is a Complex
Animal Machine</h2>

<p>The human soul knows, feels and wills. It resides
in the brain and governs the body by means
of the brain and nerves; the stomach digests the food
and makes nutriment for the body; the heart pumps
the blood to and from the several parts of it, the arteries
and veins carry the blood from the heart and back
to it; the blood carries fresh building materials to
every part of the body, and gathers up, and carries
waste matter back to the heart and lungs; the lungs
purify and enliven the blood; the liver secretes bile and
cleanses the blood; the muscles and bones move the
body and every part of it; the nerves carry messages
from the brain to every part of the body and from
every other part to the brain; the kidneys and other
organs perform their functions; the work of all these
organs being necessary to keep the body in good
working order. The brain, stomach, heart, arteries,
veins, lungs, blood, muscles, bones, kidneys, etc., may
each be considered as a complex animal machine, designed
and constructed to perform its special functions.</p>

<p>The body, as a whole, is an animal machine, which
does much work peculiar to itself.</p>

<p>The functions of all organs other than those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the brain and voluntary muscles are performed by
them, independently of the will. In other words: all
the organs of the body except the brain and the voluntary
muscles appear to act automatically as an
automatic machine does. For example, the stomach,
heart, lungs, liver and kidneys appear to do their
work as automatic machines, independently of the
will; nor has man any direct control, nor power over
the work of any of his organs except that of the
brain and voluntary muscles. Thus, he cannot directly
compel his stomach to digest his food; nor has he any
direct control over the action of his heart, nor over
that of his lungs; nor can he directly compel his liver
to secrete bile. All he can do is to take medicine or
some other substance into his stomach, and thence into
his blood to stimulate, reduce, or modify the action
of his organs; or change his environment.</p>

<p>No male has any direct control nor any voluntary
agency in the formation of spermatozoä in his
genital organs; nor has any female any control over,
nor any voluntary part in, the formation of eggs in
her ovaries. In fact fully ninety-nine per cent of mankind
are wholly ignorant of the existence of spermatozoä
and ova (eggs), having no knowledge, whatever,
of the mechanism by which their own offspring are
brought into being.</p>

<p>What are we to infer from these facts? Can we
believe that the functions of the heart and other involuntary
muscles do their work, automatically, without
the aid of any extraneous psychic force? Can we believe
that the mysterious spermatozoön, and ovum are
produced in the genital organs of the male and female,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
without their knowledge and without the aid of any
psychic or creative force, whatever? Is it possible for
the atoms of which each spermatozoön is composed, to
assemble and group themselves, automatically into it
without the aid of a supernatural psychic and creative
force? In another section of this work, I have
argued that each spermatozoön is a new, direct and
special creation. The same is true of each ovum.
I believe that the same psychic and creative force
which generates, guides and controls the forces, that
build up the body of the embryo, continues to generate,
guide and control many of the forces which
affect the human body during its whole life. I believe
that the same force determines the growth and waste
of cells; and by this means fixes the size of each
normal body. Why does an elephant grow larger than
a mouse; an ox larger than a man; an eagle larger
than a humming bird? How does it happen that all
men, elephants, mice, eagles, etc., are of substantially
the same size?</p>

<p>It is clear that neither man nor an other animal,
has any control over the growth of cells in his body,
nor over his own size. The cells of which these bodies
are built up, have no intellect, memory nor will-power.
It would be impossible for them to know when a sufficient
number of cells have been made to bring these
bodies to their proper sizes. The cells have no power
to control their production nor their waste. It follows
that the Creator must govern and control the forces,
which produce the cells in each animal body; and that
he fixes within certain limits, the form and size of
each body.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="sec9">Sec. 9. Human Body is Constructed on a
Definite and Specific Plan</h2>

<p>Every bone, joint, process, muscle, nerve, artery,
vein and part has its own chemical composition, form,
size, structure and position in the body. Each normal
human body has the same tissues, organs and
parts, that every other such body has; the form,
structure, organs and parts of all normal bodies being
identically the same.</p>

<p>If the so-called factors of evolution were at work
in every age and in every part of the earth, as maintained
by the evolutionist, we would surely find variations
and diversities in the form and structure of the
bodies of men in different ages and countries; for we
know that the environments of the different varieties
of man differ very greatly in time and space. For
example, the eskimos live all their lives in the frozen
regions at the North, while the inhabitants of the
tropics spend their lives under a blazing sun; yet
there is no anatomical difference between the body of
an Eskimo and that of a Cuban.</p>

<p>What is the inference to be drawn from these
facts? The evolutionist and the naturalist say that
the facts imply that all men have descended from a
common ancestor, that each individual inherits, from
his parents, every organ and part of his body, that
“like begets like.” They maintain that the law of
heredity has produced the uniformity of size, form,
features, organs and parts, which we discover among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
all men, all over the world. No doubt this is the belief
of more than ninety-nine (99) per cent of mankind.</p>

<p>But this belief is manifestly erroneous for the
following reasons: (1) Whatever passes from the
parents to the child is transmitted by and through
the fertilized ovum; (2) this ovum is short-lived; it
has no brain, eyes, ears, nose, touch nor taste; no intellect,
memory nor will-power; nor inherent power
to produce the embryo body; nor to endow such a
body with life; nor to create a human soul; (3) each
embryo body grows, anew, for itself, without regard to
the development and growth of its parents or any
other ancestor; and it is a new chemical combination
and a new mechanical arrangement of the atoms of
which it is composed; (4) each chemical combination
of atoms in an embryo body is made according to a
prescribed chemical formula; and each mechanical arrangement
of atoms in such a body is made according
to a specific plan; in other words the chemical combinations
and mechanical arrangements of atoms, in
each embryo body, are identically the same as those
in every other such body; (5) conscious intellect,
memory, will-power, force and motion are necessary
to combine two or more atoms chemically, according
to a prescribed formula and to group two or more
atoms, mechanically, according to a specific plan; (6)
Hence, we are compelled to believe that every human
body is a new, direct and special creation by Almighty
God.</p>

<p>Each normal human body resembles every other
such body, in form, size, and structure; in chemical
elements, organs and parts. But it differs from every
other in these particulars: (1) The atoms of which
it is composed are exclusively its own; (2) it is a

for itself, separately and apart from, and independent
of, every other such body; (4) the forces and motions,

Encyc. Brit. (9 ed.) 24, p. 818, “Variation.”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec11">Sec. 11. Force and Motion</h2>

<p>Sir Isaac Newton’s first law of motion is written
in these words:</p>

<p>“Every body continues in its state of rest, or of
uniform motion in a straight line, except in so far
as it is compelled, by force, to change that state.”&mdash;(Encyc.
Brit. (9 ed.) 15, p. 676, “Mechanics.”)</p>

<p>“Energy may be defined,” says the Britannica,
“as the power of doing work, or of overcoming resistance.
A bent spring possesses energy, for it is capable
of doing work in returning to its natural form; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
charge of gun powder possesses energy for it is capable
of doing work in exploding; a Leyden jar, charged
with electricity possesses energy, for it is capable of
doing work in being discharged.”&mdash;(Encyc. Brit. (9
ed.) 8, pp. 205-206, “Energy.”)</p>

<p>“Force is that which affects the motion of matter.”&mdash;(Encyc.
Brit. (9 ed.) 7, p. 581, “Dynamics.”)</p>

<p>“The conclusion, which appears inevitable,” it
says on another page, “is that whatever matter may
be the other reality in the physical universe, energy,
which is never found unassociated with matter, depends,
in all its widely varied forms upon motion of
matter.” (Encyc. Brit. (9 ed.) 15, p. 748, “Mechanics.”)</p>

<p>The sense of the above quotation is this: There
are two realities in the physical universe: (1) matter,
whatever it may be; (2) energy, which is always
associated with matter. Energy “depends, in all its
varied forms, upon motion of matter.” For example,
let us suppose that we have three balls, designated
as A, B, C, resting on a table in a straight line, one
inch apart. Suppose that I strike A and drive it
against B, that B strikes and moves C. In this case
my arm moves and generates energy or force, which
moves A against B, and B against C. The motion
of my arm is the force which moves A; the motion of
A is the force which moves B, and the motion of B is
the force which moves C. Thus, we have demonstrated
that energy or force generates motion; and that motions
produces force; that is, that each is convertible
into the other.</p>

<p>“Motion” is defined as “change of place; transition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
from one point or position in space to another;
continuous variation of position.” (Cent. Dic. 5, p.
3872.)</p>

<p>Every human being begins life as a fertilized
ovum, which is about as large as one-sixth of a pin’s
head. At birth, an infant weighs from five to nine
pounds, the average weight being six and one-half
pounds. (New International Encyc. 7, p. 775.) It is
then millions of times larger than a fertilized ovum.
In other words: millions of atoms have been selected,
assembled, chemically combined and mechanically arranged
and grouped in such a manner as to form the
body of a living infant, which is a complete miniature
model of the body of a man or woman.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the materials of which the
embryo body is built up, except the fertilized ovum,
are derived from the food eaten by the mother; that
her heart and arteries generate the forces and produce
the motions which carry the materials to the building
site of the embryo, just as the builder assembles the
bricks, stones, sand, lime, lumber, nails and other
materials to build a house.</p>

<p>The embryo body is a compound physical structure
built of cells, as a house is built of bricks. The
atoms and cells, of which it is composed, are subject
to all the laws of force and motion, to the same extent,
and in the same manner that bricks are. Nor
have they any more intellect, memory nor will-power
than a brick has.</p>

<p>Perhaps the first thing that an infant does, after
birth, is to breathe. In order to do this, air must
be forced into, and out of its lungs. To enable the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
heart to beat, its auricles must dilate and take the
blood into it; and its ventricles must contract and
force the blood out of it, and into the arteries. So
that every time one breathes, and every time one’s
heart beats, force is exerted and motion of air and
blood is produced. Every time one takes a drink
of water or a bite of bread he must exert sufficient
force to raise it, and produce sufficient motion to
bring it to his mouth. Every time one takes a step
he exerts sufficient force and produces sufficient motion
to move his body the distance that he steps. For
example, suppose that A, weighing two hundred
pounds, gets on an electric street car and rides a mile.
It is obvious that the electric motor has exerted sufficient
force and produced sufficient motion of A’s body
to move two hundred pounds, the distance of a mile.
Now, if A had walked along the same railway track
the same distance, it is clear that he would have exerted
the same force and produced the same motion of his
body that the motor did.</p>

<p>We eat, drink, speak, move, act, work, live&mdash;do
everything by force and motion. When they cease,
death comes.</p>

<p>Everything that a man can do with a physical
body is resolvable into force and motion. He may move
a body from one place to another; he may group two
or more bodies together; or he may take two or more
bodies apart; or he may cut or break a body into two
or more parts. But, at last, all of these operations
are equivalent to moving one or more bodies from one
place to another, by force and motion.</p>

<p>A sewing machine, adding machine, watch, steam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
engine, and every other machine is constructed by
force and motion. Every piece of music is sung or
played by force and motion. Every painting is made
by grouping two or more pigments (colors) together
in a particular manner by force and motion.</p>

<p>Intellect, memory and will-power are necessary
to produce two or more forces and motions in a
prescribed order and within a given time. For example,
each note in a piece of music requires, for its
production, a certain force and peculiar motion (vibration)
of cord, pipe or string within a certain time.
It is obvious that intellect, memory and will-power
are necessary to sing or play any piece of music.
Before anyone can speak any given word he must have
intellect, memory and will-power: (1) he must know
the word to be uttered, (2) he must remember it until
it is uttered, (3) he must have the will-power necessary
to exert the force and produce the motion of
air necessary to utter it. Let the reader speak the
words: “earth,” “air,” “fire,” “water,” and analyze
the process.</p>

<p>Intellect, memory and will-power are necessary
to generate, guide, and control the forces and motions
required to make a watch or any other compound
machine or structure, within a given time. Suppose
that a watchmaker is required to make each spring,
wheel and part of a watch by hand, to put every part
in its place and start it to running on or about the
280th day after he begins the work. (Haeckel Ev.
Man, p. 199.) To do this work he must have intellect,
memory and will-power to generate, guide, and control
and time the forces and motions which are necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to make each part of the watch and to fit and
group them together when completed. He must know
and remember every part of it; remember the material
of which it is made; remember its form and size;
compare each piece with the pattern; remember the
time in which he is to do the work. He must have the
will-power to begin and continue the work until it is
done, doing such part of it each day as to complete it
on or about the day fixed.</p>

<p>But the forces and motions, which build up the
body of the embryo, work in the dark without brain
or sense-organs. To put the watchmaker on the same
basis with the Creator, we will have to suppose that the
watchmaker is blind and has no sense of touch. Would
it be possible for him to make a watch under these
conditions?</p>

<p>The mother’s food is taken into her mouth,
chewed and mixed with saliva and passes into her
stomach. Here it is mixed with gastric juice and
converted into chyme. It then passes into the small
intestine (duodenum) where it is mixed with pancreatic
secretion, bile and “the secretion of the glands
Brunner and the Crypts of Lieberkühn” and thus
converted into chyle. Most of the “nutritive constituents”
of the chyle pass through the epithelium of
the small intestines into the subjacent blood and
lymphatic vessels and are carried off. Those passing
into the blood capillaries are taken by the portal vein
to the liver; while those entering the lacteals are carried
into the left jugular vein by the thoracic duct.
(Martin, Human Body, pp. 361-377.)</p>

<p>This is a very brief outline of the processes, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
which the food, one eats is converted into blood and
passes into the arteries and veins.</p>

<p>The embryo at first, has no heart, arteries, nor
veins. After its body has developed and grown to a
certain extent, the mother’s heart and arteries carry
arterial blood to it through the “umbilical vein.”
This blood finally reaches the heart of the embryo,
and is carried by its heart and arteries to every part
of its body, then returned through “two umbilical
arteries” and the placenta to the veins of the mother.
In this way, the embryo has a sort of circulation of its
own. But it appears to have no independent circulation
during the first three or four months of its life;
and the blood which circulates through it must be
aerated or oxygenated in the mother’s lungs.</p>

<p>We may say, in general terms, that the mother’s
heart and arteries exert all the force and produce all
the motion which build up the embryo. It is true that
the work of her heart and arteries is supplemented,
after a time, by that of the heart and arteries of the
embryo but the latter work is a small part of the
whole.</p>

<p>The water in a stream runs from its head to its
mouth because the latter is nearer to the center of the
earth than the former. In other words, the water in
every stream is carried forward by the force of
gravitation. The water in a stream carries silt (mud,
fine earth, etc.) which is deposited along its course and
at its mouth. As already stated, the mother’s blood
is carried to the embryo body by the force of her heart
and arteries. Her blood conveys to the embryo, the
materials of which it is built up, as the water in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
stream carries silt to its mouth. Her blood has no
more intellect, memory nor will-power than the water
in a stream.</p>

<p>If a portion of the silt at the mouth of the Mississippi
should be deposited at its mouth in the form of a
colossal man, showing his head, neck, body, arms,
legs, hands, feet, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, etc., it would
be considered a great miracle. But the formation of
the embryo body in the womb of its mother, with all
its organs and parts is far more miraculous than the
formation of the silt man of the Mississippi would be.</p>

<p>The reader may reply that the atoms of which
the embryo is built up are not merely deposited but
they are absorbed by the fertilized ovum and its
daughter-cells, and converted into new cells; that
these cells are chemically combined and differentiated
and mechanically arranged in such a manner as to
form the embryo body, etc. True; but force and
motion are necessary to produce new cells, to make
the necessary chemical combinations and mechanical
arrangements; and these forces and motions must be
generated, guided and controlled by a Being possessed
of a conscious intellect, memory, will-power and creative
force.</p>

<h2 id="sec12">Sec. 12. Intellect, Memory and Will-power
are Necessary, When</h2>

<p>Conscious intellect, memory and will-power are
necessary to generate, guide and control the force
and motion employed in the construction of a compound
physical structure, whatever its form or size
may be.</p>

<p>Each spermatozoön is composed of myriads of
atoms. The atoms of each are chemically combined
and mechanically arranged in the same manner that
those in every other are, all spermatozoä being identical
in chemical composition, mechanical arrangement,
form and size. The same is true of each ovum
and fertilized ovum, and of the atoms in them, respectively,
<i>vice versa</i>. So each embryo is composed of
myriads of cells, the cells in each having identically
the same chemical composition and mechanical arrangement
that those in every other embryo of the
same age and sex have; all embryos of the same age
and sex having substantially the same chemical combinations
and mechanical arrangements of their cells,
organs and parts. It follows that each human spermatozoön,
ovum, fertilized ovum and embryo, of the
same age and sex is constructed according to certain
prescribed “plans and specifications.”</p>

<p>We are, therefore, compelled to assume that the
force and motion necessary to construct the spermatozoön,
ovum, fertilized ovum and embryo are generated,
guided and controlled by a Being with full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
knowledge of the “plans and specifications,” of the
chemical elements, their affinities and combinations,
of mechanical arrangements, etc. The Architect must
know the “plans and specifications;” must be able
to compare the work of construction with them, as
the work progresses; must have memory to bear in
mind and recall the plans and specifications; and
must have will-power to begin and continue the work
until the “structure” is completed. So He must see
that each organ and part attains its proper form and
size at the right time; that each organ and part is
properly proportioned to and correlated with, every
other on each day of its growth. In other words:
He must see that the forces at work, and the motions
produced in each organ and part of the embryo body
are proportioned to and in harmony with the forces
at work and the motions produced in every other;
that the development and growth of each organ and
part keeps pace with those of every other. This
knowledge, power and creative force belongs only
to the Creator.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec13">Sec. 13. Spermatozoön</h2>

<p>A spermatozoön is a microscopic body contained
in the semen, to which the seminal fluid owes its
vitality; and which is the immediate means of impregnating
or fertilizing the ovum of the female; a
spermatic cell or filament; a spermatozoid. (Cent.
Dic. 7, p. 5819.)</p>

<p>The spermatozoön is composed of protoplasm and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
is one of the smallest cells in the animal body. The
seminal fluid is called “sperm” or “the male seed.”
Sperm, like saliva or blood, is not a simple fluid, but
is a thick agglomeration of innumerable cells swimming
about in a comparatively small quantity of fluid.
It is not the fluid, but the independent male cells,
which swim in it, that cause conception. They have,
as a rule, “a peculiarly lively motion.” In most
animals, the spermatozoä have a very small naked
body, inclosing an elongated nucleus and a long thread
like tail, hanging from it. It was long before we could
recognize that these structures were simple cells. We
now know that the spermatozoä are nothing but
simple and real cells of the kind we call “ciliated”
cells, equipped with cilia or “lashes.”</p>

<p>The body of the spermatozoön is divided into
“head,” “trunk” and “tail.” The head is merely
the oval nucleus of the cell; the body or middle part
is an accumulation of cell matter and the tail is a
thread-like prolongation of the trunk or body. The
form of the spermatozoön is not peculiar to it; cells
with similar forms are found in various other parts
of the body. Such forms as the spermatozoön are
called caudate or tailed cells. See Haeckel, <i>Evolution
of Man</i>, p. 52-53.</p>

<p>“The spermatozoä,” says Professor Martin, “are
motile bodies about 1/500th of an inch in length; they
have a flattened, clear body or head and a long vibratile
tail or cilium; the portion of the tail nearest the
head is thicker than the rest, and is known as the neck.
The mode of development of a spermatozoön shows that
the head is a cell-nucleus and the neck and tail a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
modified cell-body.”&mdash;(Martin, <i>Human Body</i>, p. 651.)</p>

<p>According to Haeckel, the spermatozoön is about
1/10,000th of an inch in diameter. See <i>Evolution of
Man</i>, p. 53, fig. 22.</p>

<p>“The striking differences,” says Haeckel, “of
[between] the respective cells, in size and shape …
are easily explained on the principle of division
of labor. The inert motionless ovum grows in size
according to the quantity of provision it stores up
in the form of nutritive yelk for the development of
the germ. The active swimming sperm-cell is reduced
in size in proportion to its need to seek the ovum and
bore its way into its yelk.”&mdash;Haeckel, <i>Evolution of
Man</i>, p. 57.</p>

<p>These statements appear to be true; but the work
described by Haeckel, cannot be done by man nor
woman; nor by their sexual organs; nor by the blind
unthinking atoms which go to build up the spermatozoön
and the ovum. The Creator only, can make them!</p>

<p>“The phenomena we have described,” he says,
on another page, “can only be understood and explained
by ascribing a certain lower degree of psychic
activity to the sexual principles. They feel each
other’s proximity and are drawn together by a sensitive
impulse (probably related to smell); they move
towards each other and do not rest until they fuse
together.” (Haeckel, <i>Evolution of Man</i>, p. 58.)</p>

<p>There is no pretense that the spermatozoön has
any brain, eyes, ears, nose, taste or touch; nor that
the ovum has any such organs. Then, how can they
have any “degree of psychic activity;” how can
“they feel each other’s proximity;” how can “they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
move towards each other?” How could either know
in what direction to go in order to reach the other?</p>

<p>It is absurd to suppose that the spermatozoön
and ovum have any knowledge of each other, or of
anything else; and the only reasonable hypothesis is
that the Creator generates, guides, and controls the
forces which bring them together and fuse them into
the germ-cell.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec14">Sec. 14. Ovum</h2>

<p>The word ovum is defined as: “An egg in a
broad biological sense; and the proper product of an
ovary; the female germ or seed, which, when fertilized
by the male sperm, is capable of developing into
an individual like the parents.… An ovum
consists of a quantity of protoplasm or cell-substance
called the vitellus or yolk inclosed in a cell-wall or
vitelline membrane, and provided with a nucleus and
nucleolus.” (Cent. Dic. 5, p. 4212.)</p>

<p>“The ovum (egg) is extremely small,” says
Haeckel, “being a tiny round vesicle about 1/120th of
an inch in diameter; it can be seen under favorable
circumstances with the naked eye as a tiny particle,
but is otherwise quite invisible. This particle is
formed in the ovary inside a much larger globule,
which takes the name of the Graäfian follicle, from
its discoverer, Graäf, and [which] had been previously
regarded as the true ovum.” (Evolution of Man,
chap. 3, pp. 16-17.)</p>

<p>“Man is developed,” says Darwin, “from an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
ovule (little egg) about the 1/125th of an inch in diameter,
which differs in no respect from the ovules
of other animals.” (Descent of Man, chap. 1, p. 9.)</p>

<p>“In man,” says Romanes, “as in most mammals,
it (the ovum or egg-cell) is about 1/120th of an inch
in diameter.” (Romanes, <i>Darwin and After Darwin</i>,
1, p. 120.)</p>

<p>Supposing the human egg to be 1/120th of an
inch in diameter and an ordinary pin’s head to be
1/16th of an inch in diameter, which is about its
size, the egg would be about 1/7th of the size of a
pin’s head.</p>

<p>Haeckel says: “In the lower vertebrates the formation
of ova (eggs) in the germ-epithelium of the
ovary continues throughout life; but in the higher
animals it is restricted to the earlier stages, or even
to the period of embryonic development.</p>

<p>“In man it seems to cease in the first year; in
the second year we find no new-formed ova (eggs)
or chains of ova (Pfluger’s tubes.) However, the
number of ova (eggs) in the two ovaries is very large
in the young girl. There are calculated to be 72,000
in the sexually mature maiden.” (<i>Evolution of Man</i>,
chap. 29, p. 347.)</p>

<p>“The human ovum,” says Haeckel, “whether fertilized,
or not, cannot be distinguished from that of
most other mammals. It is nearly the same everywhere,
in form, size, and composition. When it is
fully formed, it has a diameter of (on an average)
about 1/120th of an inch. When the mammal ovum
(egg) has been carefully isolated and held against the
light on a glass-plate, it may be seen as a fine point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
even with the naked eye. The ova (eggs) of most
of the higher animals are about the same size. The
diameter of the ovum (egg) is almost always between
1/250th and 1/125th of an inch. It has always the
same globular shape; the same characteristic membrane;
the same transparent germinal vesicle with
its dark germinal spot.</p>

<p>“Even when we use the most powerful microscope,”
he continues, “with its highest power, we can
detect no material difference between the ova (eggs)
of man, the ape, dog, and so on. I do not mean to say
that there are no differences between the ova (eggs)
of these different mammals. On the contrary, we
are bound to assume that there are such [differences]
at least as regards chemical composition. Even the
ova (eggs) of different men must differ from each
other; otherwise we should not have a different individual
from each ovum (egg). It is true that our
crude and imperfect apparatus cannot detect these
subtle individual differences which are probably in
the molecular (atomic) structure.”&mdash;(<i>Evolution of
Man</i>, <i>chap. 6</i>, p. 44.)</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec15">Sec. 15. Spermatozoön and Ovum are
Special Creations</h2>

<p>Each human spermatozoön is formed in the genital
organs of a particular man. So each human ovum
is formed in the genital organs of a particular woman.
Each of them is a new chemical combination, and a
new mechanical arrangement, of the atoms of carbon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen (protoplasm) of which
they are composed; which atoms are now, combined
and arranged, for the first and last time, into a spermatozoön
or an ovum. The atoms in a spermatozoön
are chemically combined according to a prescribed
formula, and mechanically arranged according to a
specific plan; and the same is true of the atoms
in an ovum. Each spermatozoön has the same chemical
composition and the same mechanical arrangement,
the same form and size, that every other has.
So each ovum has the same combination and arrangement,
the same form and size that every other has.</p>

<p>The materials, forces and motions employed in
making each spermatozoön are similar to those employed
in forming every other; but they are wholly
different from, and independent of, those employed in
making any other; and the same is true of the materials,
forces and motions employed in making each
ovum.</p>

<p>In other words, each spermatozoön is composed
of its own atoms, and these atoms are selected, assembled,
combined and arranged by forces and motions,
peculiar to itself, independently of and wholly different
from, the forces and motions which build up
every other. The same is true of each ovum, the
necessary changes being made.</p>

<p>It is a well known fact that each human spermatozoön
is so adapted to, and correlated with, each
human ovum that these two cells will, under suitable
conditions, fuse and produce a new human being. It
is also true that no other substance, on the earth, will
fuse with such an ovum with the same result. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
same is true of each ovum <i>vice versa</i>. These facts
prove that each spermatozoön, and each ovum, has a
specific composition, and definite arrangement of its
atoms; that each spermatozoön has the same composition,
and, substantially the same form, size, and structure
that every other has; and that each ovum has
the same composition, form, size and structure that
every other has.</p>

<p>We cannot doubt that each spermatozoön and
each ovum is produced anew, separately and apart
from, and independently of every other, the production
of each having no relation to the production
nor to the existence of any other.</p>

<p>Intellect, memory, will-power, force and motion
are necessary to group two or more atoms into a
prescribed chemical combination, or into a specified
mechanical arrangement. So supernatural, psychic
and creative force are necessary to endow the human
spermatozoön and ovum, with the vital properties
and potentialities which they are known to possess.</p>

<p>Thus it appears that each spermatozoön and each
ovum has mysterious and wonderful properties peculiar
to itself. We cannot believe that they are produced
by accident, nor by chance; nor that the atoms,
of which they are composed, assemble and group
themselves, automatically, into the form of a spermatozoön
or an ovum; nor that they are evolved by the
factors of evolution. The man in whose genital organs
the spermatozoön is formed, has no conscious part nor
voluntary agency in its production; nor has he any
control, nor any power over it. His sexual organs
“grind it out” as a mill grinds out meal. Nor has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the woman, in whose ovary the ovum is formed, any
part nor agency in its production; nor any control
nor any power over it. No man, however wise, scientific
and great he may be, can make any combination
of atoms with the properties and potentialities of
the spermatozoön; nor with those of the ovum.</p>

<p>The atoms in each spermatozoön are unique and
peculiar to it, they being similar to, but differing from,
those composing any other spermatozoön; and the
same is true of the atoms composing each ovum. So,
each spermatozoön appears to be endowed with the
power to produce a child with a form, features, characteristics
and traits resembling those of its father.
In like manner it appears that each ovum has the
power to produce a child with a form, features, qualities
and traits resembling those of its mother.</p>

<p>But the smallest ant is a giant, in comparison
with the spermatozoön or the ovum. Neither of them
has any brain, nor eyes, ears, nose, touch, nor taste&mdash;no
brain nor sense-organs. It is impossible to believe
that the spermatozoön knows the color of its
father’s hair and eyes; his complexion; the length of
his nose; the size and form of his head; his facial
expression; his characteristics and traits. Nor can
we even imagine that the ovum has any knowledge
of its mother, nor of her anatomy, organs, form,
features or characteristics.</p>

<p>But assuming for argument that the spermatozoön
and ovum do know all these things, it would be absurd
to suppose that they can, automatically, combine, arrange
and differentiate their atoms, and the new
daughter-cells, which are produced in the embryo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
body, in such manner and form as to reproduce the
hair, eyes, complexion, form, features, characteristics
and traits of the father and mother. The work, which
the spermatozoön and ovum appear to do is, in fact,
done by the Creator, Himself, He employing them
as instruments with which to do the same.</p>

<p>In view of all the facts, we are compelled to infer
that the Creator selects the atoms, which form the
spermatozoön and the ovum and that he generates,
guides and controls the forces, which assemble, group
and arrange them into the form of a spermatozoön and
ovum.</p>

<p>It follows that each human spermatozoön and
ovum is a new, direct and special creation by Almighty
God.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec16">Sec. 16. Germ-Cell, Stem-Cell or
Fertilized Ovum</h2>

<p>The fertilized ovum is variously called, “germ-cell,”
“stem-cell,” “first segmentation sphere,” “parent-cell,”
“impregnated ovum,” “fertilized egg cell,”
and other names of like import, all these phrases
meaning the same thing.</p>

<p>Under the head, “Conception,” Haeckel says,
among other things:</p>

<p>“The process of fertilization by sexual conception
consists, therefore, essentially, in the coälescence and
fusing together of two different cells. The lively
spermatozoön travels toward the ovum by its serpentine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
movements and bores its way into the female cell.
The nuclei of both sexual cells attracted by a certain
affinity approach each other and melt into one.”&mdash;(Haeckel,
Ev. Man, p. 53.)</p>

<p>How do they acquire this “affinity?” How do
they know each other? Have they intellect, memory
and will? Are they not driven toward each other by
a supernatural, psychic force?</p>

<p>Continuing he says:</p>

<p>“The fertilized cell is quite another thing from
the unfertilized cell. For if we must regard the
spermia [spermatozoä] as real cells, no less than the
ova, and the process of conception as the coälescence
of the two we must consider the resultant cell as a
quite new and independent organism. It bears in the
cell and nuclear matter of the penetrating spermatozoön
a part of the father’s body, and in the protoplasm
of the ovum a part of the mother’s body. This is
clear from the fact that the child inherits many
features from both parents. It inherits from the
father by means of the spermatozoön and from the
mother by means of the ovum. The actual blending
of the two cells produces a third cell, which is the
germ of the child, or new organism conceived. One
may also say of this sexual coälescence that <i>the stem
cell is a simple hermaphrodite</i>, it unites both sexual
substances in itself.” (Ev. Man, pp. 53-54.)</p>

<p>“The individual development,” he says, “in man
and the other animals, commences with the formation
of a simple ‘stem-cell,’ of this character, and this
then passes by repeated segmentation (or cleavage)
into a cluster of cells, known as ‘the segmentation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
sphere,’ or ‘segmentation cell.’” (Haeckel, Ev. Man,
p. 54.)</p>

<p>On another page (56) he says:</p>

<p>“Hence the essential point in the process of sexual
reproduction or impregnation is the formation of
a new cell, the stem-cell, by the combination of two
originally different cells, the female ovum and the
male spermatozoön. The process is of the highest
importance and merits our closest attention. All that
happens in the later development of this first cell,
and in the life of the organism that comes of it, is
determined from the first by the chemical and morphological
composition of the stem-cell, its nucleus and
its body.” (Ev. Man, p. 56.)</p>

<p>“Hertwig,” he continues, “puts his theory of
conception thus:</p>

<p>‘Conception consists in the copulation of two cell-nuclei,
which comes from a male and a female cell.…’</p>

<p>“As the phenomenon of heredity is inseparably
connected with the reproductive process we may
further conclude that these two copulating nuclei convey
the characteristics which are transmitted from
parents to offspring.” (Ev. of Man, p. 56.)</p>

<p>“As, moreover, there is a complete coälescence
(fusion) of the mutually attracted nuclear substances
in conception, and the new nucleus formed (the stem
nucleus) is the real starting point for the development
of the fresh organism, the further conclusion may be
drawn that the male nucleus conveys to the child the
qualities of the father, and the female nucleus the
features of the mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“We must not forget, however, that the protoplastic
bodies of the copulating cells also fuse together
in the act of impregnation; the cell-body of the invading
spermatozoön (the trunk and tail of the ciliated
cell) is dissolved in the yelk of the female ovum.
This coälescence is not so important as that of the
[two] nuclei, but it must not be overlooked; and
though the process is not so well known to us, we see
clearly at least the formation of the star-like figure,
(the radial arrangement of the particles in the plasma)
in it.” (Haeckel, Ev. Man, p. 56.)</p>

<p>In another place (p. 57) he says:</p>

<p>“It has been shown that the tiny sperm-cell
(spermatozoön) is not subordinated to but co-ordinated
with, the large ovum. The nuclei of the two cells,
as the vehicle of the hereditary features of the parents,
are of equal physiological importance. In some
cases we have succeeded in proving that the mass of
the active nuclear substance, which combines in the
copulation of the two sexual nuclei is originally the
same for both.</p>

<p>“These morphological facts are in perfect harmony
with the familiar physiological truth that the
child inherits from both parents; and that on the
average they are equally distributed. I say ‘on the
average’ because it is well known that a child may
have a greater likeness to the father, or to the mother;
that goes without saying, as far as the primary sexual
characters (the sexual glands) are concerned. But it
is also possible that the determination of the latter&mdash;the
weighty determination whether the child is to be a
boy or a girl&mdash;depends on a slight qualitative or quantitative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
difference in nuclein or the colored nuclear
matter which comes from both parents in the act of
conception.” (Ev. Man, p. 57.)</p>

<p>Haeckel continues, (p. 57):</p>

<p>“Quite in harmony with this new conception of
the equivalence of the two gonads (ovum and spermatozoön)
on the equal physiological importance of the
male and female sex-cells and their equal share in
the process of heredity, is the important fact established
by Hertwig that in normal impregnation only
one single spermatozoön copulates with one ovum; the
membrane which is raised on the surface of the yelk
immediately after one sperm-cell has penetrated, prevents
any others from entering. All the rivals of the
fortunate penetrator die without.” (Ev. Man, pp. 57-58.)</p>

<h2 id="sec17">Sec. 17. Germ-Cell Does Not Contain Any
Skeleton, Model nor Performed Outline
of the Coming Embryo</h2>

<p>At this point it should be noted that the stem-cell
does not contain any skeleton, model nor other
preformed outline of the coming embryo for the following
reasons: (1) neither the ovum nor the spermatozoön
contains any such skeleton, model nor outline;
and if each of them contain such a thing, both would
be destroyed when these primary cells fuse and merge
into the germ-cell. (2) The germ-cell first divides
into two, four, eight, sixteen, thirty-two, and sixty-four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
daughter-cells, and so on into the millions; and
this segmentation of the stem-cell and daughter-cells
would surely annihilate any skeleton, model or other
outline that might exist in the germ-cell; (3) the
germ-cell first divides into two daughter-cells and so
on, to infinity, as already stated; and these daughter-cells
form what are called “germ-layers” or sheets of
cells from which the human body and all of its
organs and parts are built up. (Haeckel, Ev. Man,
pp. 14, 16, 59, 92; Encyc. Brit., (9th ed.) 3, p. 682;
8, pp. 165, 744; 24, p. 631; Cent. Dic. 3, p. 2500,
“Germ-layer.”)</p>

<p>This mode of growth, by the segmentation of cells
and formation of germ-layers, is called “epigenesis”
which Huxley defines as “the successive differentiation
of a relatively homogeneous rudiment, into the
parts and structures, which characterize the adult.”
(Encyc. Brit. 8, p. 744. Cent. Dic. 3, p. 1968, “Epigenesis.”)</p>

<p>According to the theory of <i>epigenesis</i>, which is
now held by all the scientific world, the human body
grows anew from the germ-cell, without any skeleton
model or any other kind of preformation.</p>

<p>“Every living thing,” says Huxley, “is evolved
from a particle of matter, in which no trace of the
distinctive characters of the adult form of that living
thing is discernible. This particle is termed a <i>germ</i>.”
(Encyc. Brit. (9 ed.) 8, p. 746.)</p>

<p>He defines a germ as “matter potentially alive,
and having, within itself, the tendency to assume a
definite living form;” and says that this definition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
“appears to meet all the requirements of modern
science.” (Encyc. Brit. (9 ed.) 8, p. 746.)</p>

<p>“In all cases,” he says, “the process of evolution
[growth] consists in a succession of changes of the
form, structure and functions of the germ [fertilized
ovum], by which it passes, step by step, from an extreme
simplicity, or relative homogeneity, of visible
structure to a greater or less degree of complexity or
heterogeneity; and the course of progressive differentiation
is usually accompanied by growth, which is
effected by intussusception.” (Encyc. Brit. 8, p. 746.)</p>

<p>Huxley is surely mistaken in saying that “the
process of evolution [development and growth] consists
in a succession of changes in the form, structure
and functions of the germ,” for the germ (fertilized
ovum) immediately divides into two daughter-cells,
these into four, these into eight, sixteen and so on to
infinity. Thus, it appears that germ (germ-cell) becomes
“a drop in the sea,” its identity being wholly
lost. Huxley states this fact, in substance, in the
quotation below.</p>

<p>“The substance,” he says, “by the addition of
which the germ is enlarged is in no case, simply absorbed
ready-made form the not-living world, and
packed between the elementary constituents of the
germ.… The new material is, in a great
measure, not only absorbed but assimilated, so that
it become part and parcel of the molecular structure
of the living body into which it enters. And so far
from the fully developed organism’s being simply the
germ plus the nutriment which it has absorbed, it is
probable that the adult contains neither in form, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
in substance, more than an inappreciable fraction of
the constituents of the germ; and that it is almost
wholly made up of assimilated and metamorphosed nutriment.
In the great majority of cases, at any rate,
the full grown organism becomes what it is by the absorption
of not-living matter, and its conversion into
living matter of a specific type.” (Encyc. Brit. (9 ed.)
8, p. 746.)</p>

<p>The substance of these quotations is that the germ
(fertilized ovum) has, within itself, a tendency to
assume the form of a man or woman. But, as above
remarked, this is not true. On the contrary the
“germ” divides into two daughter-cells, and these
continue to divide until millions of them are produced.
These daughter-cells are so distributed, combined, differentiated,
grouped and arranged as to produce the
embryo body with all its organs and parts. According
to Huxley and other materialists the “germ” and
its daughter-cells do all this work spontaneously without
the aid or guidance of any extraneous psychic or
creative force. Is this possible?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="sec18">Sec. 18. Germ-Cell Has No Inherent
Power to Evolve, Spontaneously and
Automatically, the Body and
Organs of the Embryo</h2>

<p>The germ-cell (fertilized ovum) has no brain, no
eyes, ears, nose, touch, nor taste&mdash;no brain nor sense-organs&mdash;no
organs whatever. It has no knowledge of
chemical elements; nor of their affinities; nor of their
combinations. It has no knowledge of mechanical arrangement;
no knowledge of the human body nor of
its organs and parts; nor of their chemical constituents;
nor of their mechanical arrangement. It has no
idea of time nor space; nor of the adaption of a means
to an end; nor of a contrivance.</p>

<p>The germ-cell has no memory of any of these
things, for it is impossible for any being to remember
a thing that it never knew. This would be a contradiction
of terms&mdash;an absurdity. I know that Haeckel
and other writers speak of “unconscious memory,”
“organic memory,” etc. But these are vagaries of the
evolutionist and materialist, having no foundation in
fact.</p>

<p>So far as our experience goes, there is no such
thing as intellect nor memory without and apart from
a living physical body. Before there can be intellect
or memory, there must be such body to serve as
its dwelling place. It is absurd to suppose that the
spermatozoön, the ovum or the fertilized ovum has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
intellect or memory. But even if any of the three
has either of these faculties, it would be preposterous
to suppose that the spermatozoön, ovum or fertilized
ovum, remembers anything that happened before the
atoms, of which it is composed, were grouped together
as such. In other words, we cannot even imagine that
any living being remembers anything that happened
before it came into existence as such being. It is
too clear for argument that no parent ever transmits
to his or her child the memory of any thing that he
or she ever saw, heard, felt or knew. Every man
knows that he has no memory of anything that happened
to either of his parents. It follows that the
memory of each animal is limited to the period of his
own existence, as such; and that there is no such thing
as “unconscious memory,” or “organic memory,” in
the sense in which these terms are used by the evolutionist.</p>

<p>But “unconscious memory,” “organic memory,”
etc., if there were any such thing, have no constructive
force. I might have a vivid memory of every spring,
wheel, and part of a watch and yet have no power
to make one. So, an anatomist may know and remember
every bone, muscle, artery, vein, nerve and
part of the human body; but this knowledge and
memory would not enable him to form the chemical
combinations and make the mechanical arrangements
necessary to construct the human body and impart life
to it.</p>

<p>Nor has the germ-cell any will-power to begin
and continue the work of building up the embryo body
until it is completed. We cannot even imagine that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the germ-cell has the semblance of a will in any sense
of the term.</p>

<p>To construct the embryo body a sufficient number
of atoms of the necessary chemical elements, such as
carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, etc., must be selected,
assembled at the proper places and there combined,
in certain proportions, to form the required
chemical combinations; next these combinations must
be grouped and mechanically arranged in such a
manner as to form the embryo body, with all its organs
and parts in their proper places.</p>

<p>Can the germ-cell, and the millions of daughter-cells
arising from it, do this miraculous work, automatically,
without the aid and guidance of the Creator?</p>

<p>Let us imagine that Edison or some other scientific
man should build a tank large enough to hold
a brick house with six rooms; that he put into the
tank a “magic brick,” composed of silica, aluminum,
iron, lime, magnesia, manganese, soda and potash combined
in the proper proportions, (Encyc. Brit. 4, p.
280); that he turned a stream of water, charged with
these elements, upon the brick; that it absorbed these
substances from the water and assimilated them into
its own body; that it afterward split into two “daughter-bricks,”
these two into four, these into eight, sixteen,
thirty-two, sixty-four, one hundred and twenty-eight,
and so on to infinity; that these bricks, automatically,
assumed such positions on top of each other as
to build up the four walls of the house, without the
aid of man or any other psychic force; that the bricks
left spaces for doors, windows, etc.; that they also
built up the chimneys, fire places, etc.; that some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the bricks, spontaneously, metamorphosed themselves
into marble slabs for window-sills, door-sills, hearth-stones,
etc.; that other bricks were converted into
oaken mantels, with mirrors, etc.; that others were
converted into slabs of slate and assumed the proper
form, size and positions to form a slate roof!</p>

<p>If any such thing should ever happen it would
be justly considered a great miracle.</p>

<p>But the development and growth of the embryo
are far more mysterious and wonderful than the building
of a house in this manner would be; for the embryo
is a live miniature model of a man or woman&mdash;the
work of a supernatural creative force&mdash;Almighty
God.</p>

<p>Huxley says, in substance, that the germ-cell has
“within itself the tendency to assume a definite living
form.” He also says “that the great characteristic
of the germ is, not so much what is, but what it may,
under suitable conditions, become.”&mdash;(Encyc. Brit.
(9 ed.) 8, p. 746.)</p>

<p>The common belief of mankind, in general, is that
the germ-cell, spontaneously and automatically, develops
and grows to be a man or woman, without the aid
of any extraneous psychic or creative force.</p>

<p>But it is clear that the germ-cell divides into
two, four, eight, sixteen, thirty-two and sixty-four
daughter-cells; and so on to infinity. It follows that
the germ-cell is annihilated within a few hours after
it is formed; and that its identity, as the germ-cell is
wholly lost in the myriads of daughter-cells which
arise from it, and go to build up the embryo body;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
each daughter-cell containing, theoretically, a portion
of the germ-cell.</p>

<p>It follows that the germ-cell has no tendency
“within itself to assume a definite living form;” nor
has it any power to become a living form, nor anything
else.</p>

<p>Obviously, the microscopic germ-cell, when whole,
would be powerless to develop and grow to be a man
or woman; and for a much stronger reason the infinitesimal
fragments of it would be powerless to do
these things.</p>

<p>Apparently, the Creator uses the germ-cell to inaugurate
the growth of daughter-cells in the embryo
body, in the same manner that a grain of wheat is used
to start the growth of a stalk of wheat.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec19">Sec. 19. Reproduction, its Phenomena</h2>

<p>All the phenomena of reproduction may be
grouped under the following heads: (1) Production
of the spermatozoön, (2) production of the ovum, (3)
their fusion into the fertilized ovum, (4) production
of daughter-cells, (5) distribution, mechanical arrangement
and grouping of cells, (6) differentiation of
cells into the different tissues, (7) waste of cells.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec20">Sec. 20. Spermatozoön, its Production</h2>

<p>The first step toward the reproduction of a man,
woman, or any other mammal, (an individual of a
species which suckles its young), is the formation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
a spermatozoön in the genital organs of a male. See
<a href="#Index">index</a>, infra, “Spermatozoön.”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec21">Sec. 21. Ovum, its Production</h2>

<p>The production of an ovum in the genital organs
of a female is the second step. It is immaterial which
of them is produced first. The essential point is that
they shall meet and fuse into the fertilized ovum.</p>

<p>See <a href="#sec14">Sec. 14</a>, supra; <a href="#Index">Index</a>, infra, “ovum.”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec22">Sec. 22. Germ-Cell, its Production</h2>

<p>The third step is the fusion of the spermatozoön
and ovum into the germ-cell, stem-cell or fertilized
ovum. See <a href="#Index">index</a>, infra, “germ-cell,” “stem-cell,”
“fertilized ovum.”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec23">Sec. 23. Daughter-Cells, Their Production</h2>

<p>The fourth step is the production of daughter-cells.
The germ-cell (fertilized ovum) is the primordial
cell, from which every other cell in the human body is
directly or indirectly, produced by fission or self-division.
As already stated, the germ-cell divides into
two daughter-cells, these into four, these into
eight, sixteen, and so on to infinity. Every cell is
composed of a vast number of atoms. A portion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
these atoms is differentiated into “the inner nucleus
(caryoplasm)” and “the body of the cell (cytoplasm).”
(Haeckel, Ev. Man, p. 38.) Again he says:
“In a mesh of the nuclear net-work … there
is, as a rule, a dark, very opaque, solid body, called
the nucleolus.” (Ev. Man, p. 38.) On another page,
he says: “Some cells have a ‘nucleolinus’ in the center
of the nucleolus.” (Ev. Man, p. 40, fig. 9.)</p>

<p>We cannot believe that any microscopic cell in
the human body has intellect, memory, will-power nor
creative force. For a stronger reason, we cannot imagine
that any of the atoms of which any cell is composed,
has these faculties. Nor can we conceive that
a portion of these atoms, automatically, metamorphose
themselves into a nucleolus, others into a nucleolinus,
while the remainder continue to be a simple cell-body.</p>

<p>How do the cells know when the time has come
to divide into two daughter-cells; where the dividing
line should run in order to divide the cell-body, nucleus
and nucleolus into two equal parts? For further
discussion of cells see <a href="#Index">Index</a>, infra, “cell.”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec24">Sec. 24. Animals, Their Sizes are Determined,
How?</h2>

<p>Why does the elephant grow larger than the
mouse. Both are mammals and are built of cells. The
mouse has identically the same organs and parts that
the elephant has. The mode of reproducing each is
the same as that of the other. The spermatozoön,
ovum and germ-cell are common to both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>How does it happen that all normal adult individuals
of each species of animal in a given region
and of each sex, have substantially the same form
and size, called: “the mode?”</p>

<p>The reader may reply that nature fixes the size
and form of every individual of each species. The
evolutionist will say that the law of heredity and environment
determine the sizes and forms of animals
and plants; that the mouse is small because his ancestors
were small; that the elephant is large because
his were large.</p>

<p>But these replies do not explain the phenomena.
Each animal grows anew, for itself. His body is a
new combination of the atoms and cells of which it
is composed. The forces and motions employed in
its construction are new and peculiar to it. When
the cells in an embryo body begin to grow there is
no apparent reason why they should not continue to
grow and multiply, forever. Now, what psychic force
or agency ascertains and determines when the work
of building up the animal body has been completed?
What force or agency equalizes the growth and waste
of cells in a mature animal body and keeps it of the
same form, size, and weight until the decay of old age
comes on?</p>

<p>The size of every animal depends upon the size
and number of cells in his body; and its form is determined
by the manner in which these cells are
grouped together. For example there are more cells
in the nose (trunk) and teeth (tusks) of the elephant,
in proportion to the size of his body, than there are
in those of the mouse in proportion to his. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
clear that a mouse would grow to be as large as an
elephant if the cells in his body continued to grow
and multiply for a sufficient period of time. Why
do the cells cease to multiply when the mouse has attained
a certain size? Why do they stop work in the
elephant’s body when he gets his normal growth? Do
the cells in the mouse and those in the elephant know
when their work is done? How do they know it?</p>

<p>The materialist denies the existence of a First
Cause and maintains that every animal and plant is
the result of “a natural continuous and necessary
evolution.” (Haeckel, Evolution of Man, p. 26.)
Huxley says, in effect, that “secondary causes” produce
all the phenomena of the physical universe; and
that man and the rest of the living world “are all
co-ordinated terms in nature’s great progression.”
(Man’s Place in Nature, pp. 150-151.)</p>

<p>But it appears that the materialist maintains
that the law of heredity is fixed and unchangeable, at
all events it is proof against secondary causes. For
example, no sort of treatment, nor any kind nor
quantity of food will make a mouse grow to the size
of an elephant nor any larger than his ancestors were.
Food and environment are “secondary causes;” but
they have no power to change the form nor the size
of the animal body.</p>

<p>Since all normal adult individuals of each species
of animals, all over the earth, and in every age, have
substantially the same form and size; and since each
individual is built up, anew, of new cells (or atoms)
by new forces and motions, we are compelled to assume
that the same psychic force or agency determines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the number of cells which shall go into each normal
body, and the manner in which these cells shall be
grouped together. In brief, the same supernatural
psychic and creative force, always, determines the
form and size of each animal, all over the earth.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec25">Sec. 25. Distribution and Grouping of
Cells in the Embryo Body</h2>

<p>As already stated, every man and woman begins
life as a germ-cell or fertilized ovum. This cell grows
and divides into two daughter-cells; these into four,
eight, sixteen, thirty-two, and so on. At first these
daughter-cells are so distributed and grouped as to
form a solid ball called “the morula;” next they
take the form of a hollow ball, called “the blastula”
with a single layer or sheet of cells and a fluid in
the center; next a group of cells with two layers,
called “the gastrula;” then they are so distributed or
grouped as to form two germ-layers or sheets of cells,
then into three layers, then into four. At this point
a portion of the cells is so grouped as to begin the
formation of the spinal cord and brain; and in course
of time, other cells are so distributed and grouped as
to form the bones, muscles, nerves, arteries, veins,
heart, lungs, stomach, liver, kidneys, intestines, arms,
hands, legs, feet and other organs and parts of the
body.</p>

<p>The form of any animal body and each organ and
part of such a body, depends upon the manner in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
its cells are distributed and grouped. Thus, the form
of the whale, elephant, giraffe, camel, lion, tiger, hippopotamus,
alligator, python, horse, cow, eagle and
humming-bird, is produced by the distribution of the
cells or atoms in their bodies. If a man has a very
large head, a long nose or big foot we are compelled
to infer that these peculiarities are the result of depositing
an unusual number of cells (“organic bricks”)
in these parts of his body.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac Newton states his first law of motion
in the words following:</p>

<p>“Everybody continues in its state of rest, or of
uniform motion in a straight line, except in so far
as it is compelled, by force, to change that state.”&mdash;(Encyc.
Brit. (9 ed.) 15, p. 676.)</p>

<p>For example, if one should lay a stone on the
ground it would remain there forever, unless moved by
some sort of force. It would be absurd to suppose
that the stone could, automatically, move itself.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as making <i>any thing</i> out
of <i>nothing</i>. Every thing is made of some other thing.
The body of the horse is made of corn, hay and other
vegetable and mineral substances. So the human body
is made of bread, meat and other food-stuffs, eaten by
the mother before birth and by the individual, himself,
after birth. The germ-cell is deposited in the
womb of its mother. It cannot develop nor grow,
unless it receive nourishment from her body. She
eats bread, meat and other things, these are converted
into blood, and a portion of it is carried, by the force
of her heart and arteries, to the germ-cell; it absorbs
and assimilates a portion of the blood; produces cells;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and these are so distributed and grouped as to form
the embryo body with all its organs and parts.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the father has nothing to do
with the circulation of the mother’s blood, which conveys
nourishment to the embryo; it is equally clear
that she has no conscious part in the circulation of
her own blood, and that she has no power nor control
over the development nor the growth of the
embryo, except such as she may exert indirectly by
the food which she eats.</p>

<p>The embryo begins life as a germ-cell. Atoms of
building material must be conveyed, by the blood of
the mother, to this cell, otherwise, it cannot develop
nor grow. As new cells are produced, they are so
distributed and grouped as to form the several organs
and parts of the embryo body; or it may be said that
new cells are produced and added to older cells, at
such points as to build up the embryo organs and
parts. For example, arm-buds and leg-buds appear
on the surface of the trunk, as slight swellings or projections;
new cells are added to these buds; they grow,
in length, by the addition of cells at the distal (outer)
ends, until they have attained the proper length, terminating
in the fingers and toes. So the arms and
legs grow to some extent in diameter by the addition of
new cells; but the number of cells, which go to extend
the length of the arms and legs, greatly exceeds the
number which go to increase the diameter.</p>

<p>Every atom in a cell is a physical body, like a
brick, and must be moved by extraneous force, having
no power to lift and move itself, automatically. It
may be said that the heart and arteries of the mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
furnish the energy, which moves the atoms to the
building site of the cells, in the first instance. But
the atoms are not only moved; they are carried at
the proper time and deposited at the right place to
build up the organ or part which is being constructed.
We cannot believe that the mother has any knowledge
of, nor power over, the distribution of the atoms and
cells, which go to build up the embryo body; nor can
we even imagine that the embryo itself distributes
them. So it would be absurd to suppose that the
atoms and cells move and distribute themselves, automatically,
in such a manner as to build up the embryo.</p>

<p>How do the cells know when to begin the formation
of the morula? How do they know when it
has been completed and when to begin the construction
of the blastula? How do they know when to
take the form of the gastrula, and when to enter the
next stage?</p>

<p>The forces and motions required to build up the
morula (a solid ball) are different from those required
to construct the blastula (a hollow ball) and the gastrula
(a two-layered hollow group of cells with an
aperture at one end of it); the morula, blastula and
gastrula, each, requiring forces and motions peculiar
to itself. Now, what psychic force stops the forces
and motions, which build up the morula, and sets
to work the forces which construct the blastula and
afterward the gastrula?</p>

<p>It is obvious that these cells, (if there be enough
of them), may be so grouped as to form a sphere, cube,
cylinder, plate or any other figure; and that any of
these may be solid, hollow or porous. The head, brain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
heart, kidneys and some other parts of the embryo,
approximate the form of a sphere; the trunk, arms,
legs and many bones are approximately cylindrical;
other bones take the form of a plate, for example the
bones of the skull. The form and shape of the embryo,
and of every organ and part of it, depends entirely
upon the manner in which its component cells are
grouped.</p>

<p>How is it possible for these unthinking microscopic
cells to know at what point to begin, and in what
direction to grow, and in what manner they shall
group themselves, in order to construct the skeleton,
brain, spinal cord, heart, lungs, stomach, liver, kidneys,
etc.?</p>

<p>The only reasonable hypothesis is that the production
and placing of cells in the embryo body are
directed and controlled by a supernatural psychic and
creative force.</p>

<p>After the formation of a rudimentary head and
trunk, two “arm-buds” and two “leg-buds” appear
on the surface of the trunk. At first these “buds”
are slight swellings or projections, but they soon take
the form of a cylinder and continue to grow mainly
in length and slightly in diameter, until the man or
woman has finished his or her growth. Every embryo
that ever existed, grew and behaved in this
same manner, thus showing that the same supernatural
psychic and creative force directed and controlled
the growth and deposit of cells in the body of every
man and woman that ever lived.</p>

<p>How could the cells possibly know at what point,
on the body of the embryo, to group themselves together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
in order to build up the arms and legs? How
could they contrive to give the arms and legs the form
of a cylinder, the length being several times as great
as the diameter? How could the cells possibly know
that there should be only one bone in each arm above
the elbow and two below the elbow and the wrist?
How could they know the number of bones that
should be placed between the wrist and fingers? How
could they know that there should be a thumb and four
fingers in each hand and the number of joints in each
finger? How could it be possible for the blind unthinking
cells to build up the two legs and feet, with
all their bones, processes, joints, muscles, nerves, arteries,
veins, etc., without the aid and direction of a
supernatural psychic and creative force?</p>

<p>We are, therefore, compelled to assume that the
Creator generates, guides, and controls the forces
which distribute and group the atoms and cells in the
body of the embryo.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec26">Sec. 26. Distribution and Grouping of
Cells in the Embryo Body, Continued</h2>

<p>The atoms and cells of which the embryo body is
built up, and those of which each organ and part is
made, are carried to “the building site” and there
grouped by force. This force, whatever it may be,
must be sufficient to overcome the force of gravity
and the friction, which one atom or cell encounters in
moving on the surface of another. This force must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
be guided and controlled by a Being with a conscious
intellect, memory and will-power in order to build up
the embryo body, or one of its organs, and give it
the proper form and size; for the right number of
atoms or cells must be carried to “the building site”
of each organ and part, or it will be too large or too
small, and out of proportion to the other parts of the
body; and these atoms or cells must be so grouped as
to give the organ or part the correct form&mdash;not too
long, too wide nor too thick; else it will not fit into
its place, nor be in harmony with the other parts of
the body. Intellect, memory and judgment are necessary
to construct the body or any part of it with
atoms or cells, for the builder must know the anatomy
of the body; must know the time when each part of
the work must be done; must know the relation of
each part to every other part; must know the proper
form and size of each part, and the present form and
size; must compare each part with every other in order
to preserve harmony and due proportion among all
the parts, in form, size and function.</p>

<p>The atoms of lime, phosphorus, carbon and oxygen,
are assembled in the body of the embryo and combined
in such manner as to make the rudimentary
bones rigid and stable; others are assembled, combined
and so grouped as to form the muscles; others
to form the brain, spinal cord and nerves; others to
form the arteries, veins, etc.; each of these tissues has
its own chemical composition and molecular structure,
radically different from the composition and structure
of every other tissue. Moreover, these chemical and
molecular changes (specializations) are made side by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
side at the same time, all at once, the muscles being
attached to the bones, and the nerves, arteries and
veins, ramifying through the muscles, bones, etc. Not
only so, but the atoms and cells, which form the bones,
muscles, nerves, arteries, veins, etc., are assembled,
grouped and specialized at the exact points, at which
these tissues are needed to build up the embryo body.</p>

<p>What force or agency does this miraculous work?
Surely, it is not the father, nor the mother. It is not
done by accident nor by chance, for the same things
happen in the development and growth of every normal
embryo body in every age and country the world
over. All this wonderful work is done in every embryo
body by the same psychic and creative force, whose
work is uniform, continuous and everlasting.</p>

<p>The evolutionist says the development and growth
of an embryo results from “heredity;” that the child
develops and grows as it does because its father and
mother and all their ancestors, for thousands of generations
developed and grew in the same manner;
and that the embryo develops and grows by “a natural
continuous and necessary evolution.”&mdash;(Haeckel, Ev.
Man, p. 26.)</p>

<p>This is absurd, for the cells which build up the
embryo, are new combinations of the atoms of which
they are composed; each embryo develops and grows
anew for itself; neither the germ-cell nor any of its
daughter-cells has any knowledge of the father, nor
of the mother; nor of their mode of development and
growth; nor of their organs and parts; nor has the
embryo any power nor control over its own development
and growth, nor to imitate the development and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
growth of its parents, even if it knew how they developed
and grew.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec27">Sec. 27. Differentiation (Metamorphosis)
of Simple-Cells Into Bone-Cells, Muscle-Cells,
Nerve-Cells, Vascular-Cells,
Gland-Cells, Etc.</h2>

<p>A cell is said to be “a simple-cell,” when it is composed
of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen, with
a possible trace of phosphorus and sulphur,&mdash;when it
consists of plain protoplasm&mdash;and before it has been
differentiated into a bone-cell, muscle-cell, nerve-cell
or the like. To convert a simple-cell into one of these
specialized cells certain atoms must be added to it,
or taken from it; or certain atoms must be taken away
and others added to it; or the chemical combination
of atoms in it must be broken down and new ones
formed. There is no change in the properties of the
chemical elements, which compose the human body.
For example, the nature and properties of carbon,
hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen remain the same
whether they are in or out of the body, and the same
is true of every other element.</p>

<p>The differentiation of simple-cells into bone-cells,
muscle-cells, nerve-cells, vascular-cells, gland-cells, etc.,
is effected by changing the chemical elements, which
enter into their composition; or by changing the proportion
of these elements to one another and altering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
their molecular structure. In fact, it appears that
every differentiation and specialization of any animal,
or of any organ or part of one, is accomplished by
changing its chemical constituents; or by changing
their relative proportions to one another and thereby
modifying its molecular structure, and by changing
the mechanical arrangement of its atoms and cells.</p>

<p>The entire work of building up the embryo body
is done by making new chemical combinations and
new mechanical arrangements of the atoms and cells
of which it is composed.</p>

<p>Referring to the residue of the dry bone, which
remains after calcining it (burning away the soft
parts of it), Professor Martin says:</p>

<p>“The residue forms a white, very brittle mass, retaining,
perfectly the shape and structural details of
the original bone. It consists of normal calcium (lime)
phosphate or <i>bone-earth</i> (CA₃, 2PO₄); but there is
also present a considerable proportion of calcium
[lime] carbonate (CaCO₃) and smaller quantities of
other salts.” (Martin, Human Body, p. 90.)</p>

<p>Under the head: “The Chemistry of Muscular
Tissue,” he says:</p>

<p>“Muscle contains 75 per cent of water; and among
other inorganic constituents, phosphates and chlorides
of potassium, sodium and magnesium.” (Human
Body, p. 123.)</p>

<p>According to this statement there is no lime
in the muscles; and we cannot believe there is any of
this substance in any tissue of the body except the
bones; for every other tissue is soft and flexible. It
is clear that the purpose of putting lime into the bones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
is to make them rigid and stable in order to support
the body and keep all its organs and parts in place.</p>

<p>What force or agency assembles the atoms of lime,
phosphorus, carbon and oxygen, and combines them
into the phosphate of lime, and the carbonate of lime,
to make the bones rigid and stable? Surely, it is not
the father, nor the mother, nor the embryo itself. It
would be preposterous to suppose that the atoms of
lime, phosphorus, carbon and oxygen, of their own motion,
and automatically, assemble and combine themselves,
chemically, in such proportions as to form the
phosphate of lime, and the carbonate of lime in the
bones; and that these atoms of the phosphate and carbonate
of lime group themselves, automatically, into
such mechanical arrangements as to form the bones
with all their processes, joints, cavities, perforations,
etc., and fit them together in the form of the skeleton.</p>

<p>The formation of bones in the body of a single
animal, might, possibly happen by accident or chance.
But when bones are formed in the bodies of all animals
of the same species for thousands, or millions, of
years and when all of them, in the bodies of each
species, have the same chemical composition, the same
structure, form and size; we are compelled to assume
that the same cause, force or agency, which produces
bones in each body, also produces them in every other
body; in brief that all bones are made by the same
supernatural psychic and creative force. The same
is true of every other tissue.</p>

<p>But the evolutionist says that “heredity” works
this miracle. In other words, that this metamorphosis
of simple-cells into bones, muscles, nerves, etc., happens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
because certain similar cells in the bodies of the
father and mother were changed in the same manner.
He overlooks the fact that the cells, bones, etc., in
the embryo body are new and altogether different from
those which were metamorphosed in the bodies of its
parents and that the forces which did that work were
exhausted in doing it. He forgets or ignores the fact
that neither the germ-cell nor any of its daughter-cells
has any intellect, memory, will-power or creative
force; that they have no knowledge of chemistry, nor
of lime, phosphorus, carbon, oxygen, nor of their
affinities; nor of bones; nor of their forms, sizes and
functions.</p>

<p>The differentiation and specialization (metamorphosis)
of cells and tissues; and their mechanical arrangement
and grouping into the several organs and
parts of the embryo body are not the work of blind
mechanical forces; nor of chance; nor of accident; nor
of unthinking cells; but of the Almighty Creator.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec28">Sec. 28. Waste of Cells</h2>

<p>So soon as the embryo begins to grow, the waste
of cells begins; and continues until the death of the
individual, however long he may live. “The knowledge
is wanting,” says the Britannica, “which would
tell us, when a certain limit has been attained, the
process of income and expenditure balance and growth
ceases.”&mdash;(Encyc. Brit. 17, p. 686.) “During life,”
says Professor Martin, “all the formed elements of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
body are constantly being broken down and removed;
either molecularly, (that is bit by bit, while the general
size and form of the cell or fibre remains unaltered)
or in mass, as when the hairs and the cuticle
are shed.” (Martin, Human Body, p. 670.)</p>

<p>See Encyc. Brit. 17, pp. 686-687; Martin, Human
Body, pp. 451-476, 670-671; New International Encyc.
9, pp. 312-315.</p>

<p>The waste of cells affects the growth of the body,
only so far as it tends to neutralize and offset the
increase of the body by the multiplication of cells.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec29">Sec. 29. Embryo Body is Built up of Inanimate
Atoms Except the Germ-Cell</h2>

<p>The germ-cell (fertilized ovum) is the physical
basis of every human body. Such an ovum is said
to be potentially alive because it may, with the aid of
the Creator, develop into a living individual. Excepting
this tiny bit of flesh-like substance, which is barely
visible to the naked eye, and which is not one trillionth
part of the infant at birth, every part of the human
embryo is built up of inanimate atoms, which are carried
and distributed to the growing embryo by the
blood of the mother. These dead atoms are then assimilated
by the embryo and incorporated into its
growing body.</p>

<p>The fertilized ovum is soon split and divided into
millions of pieces, by the division of cells, and lost in
the general mass of the embryo body like a drop in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the sea. It appears that the chief office of the fertilized
ovum is to inaugurate the growth and multiplication
of cells, which are, finally, differentiated and
specialized into the several organs and parts of the
embryo body.</p>

<p>These facts serve to show the extent of the supernatural
creative work done in the embryo body.
It is a new living body, with all its organs and parts
made of inanimate matter, except the germ-cell.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec30">Sec. 30. Embryo Body; Each is Produced
Anew</h2>

<p>The embryo is built of certain chemical elements,
namely: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, etc. See
<a href="#sec3">sec. 3</a>, supra, and <a href="#Index">index</a>, infra, “Chemical elements.”
It derives its properties and potentialities from certain
chemical combinations and mechanical arrangements
of these elements, and from life. All of these
combinations and arrangements are made after the
formation of the fertilized ovum. Even if this ovum
and its daughter-cells could build up the embryo body,
automatically, yet it must grow anew for itself, independently
of the growth of the bodies of its parents,
or any other person; for it must have its own body,
and not that of its father, mother, nor of any other
person. It is composed of new materials, except the
fertilized ovum, which is too small to be considered in
comparison with the body of the embryo, as a whole.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
These new materials are derived from the blood of
the mother.</p>

<p>No embryo ever takes or uses any organ or part
of the body of its father, or mother, except the spermatozoön
and the ovum, which form the germ-cell and
serve as a germ to start the growth of the body. Each
embryo is a new combination and a new arrangement
of the atoms and cells of which it is composed. It
is produced by new forces and motions peculiar to
itself, which are similar to, but different from, those
which produce every other embryo body. It is admitted
on all sides, that every human being begins life as
a fertilized ovum. It is well known that this infinitesimal
cell has no organs, whatever, it being a mere
atom. In no sense can it be called an embryo body.
Each person must have his or her own body. No one
ever takes or uses the body of any other person, nor
any organ or part of such a body, such a thing being
unthinkable. It follows, necessarily, that each embryo
body and every organ and part of it, is produced
anew, independently of every other human
body.</p>

<p>Do the atoms and cells of which the embryo body
is built up, spontaneously and automatically, form the
chemical combinations and make the mechanical arrangements,
which are necessary to build up the embryo
body; or is it made by a supernatural psychic
and creative force? Which hypothesis is most plausible?</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="sec31">Sec. 31. Heredity has no Power to Generate
a New Human Being; nor to
Evolve One from the Germ-Cell</h2>

<p>Heredity is defined as: “The influence of parents
upon offspring; transmission of qualities or characteristics,
mental or physical, from parents to offspring.”
(Cent. Dic. 4, p. 2802.)</p>

<p>Intellect, memory, will-power, force and motion
are necessary to group two or more atoms into a prescribed
chemical combination or into a specified mechanical
arrangement. It is a well-known fact that
each normal human body is composed of the same
chemical elements; has the same chemical combinations
and the same mechanical arrangements that are
found in every other such body. Therefore, we may
well say that the atoms and cells in the body are
grouped into prescribed chemical combinations and
into specified mechanical arrangements; and that intellect,
memory and will-power are necessary to make
these combinations and arrangements.</p>

<p>It is also well-known that every human being,
begins life as a germ-cell, stem-cell, or fertilized ovum,
all of these phrases meaning the same thing; that
every such body develops and grows anew for itself.
Each body is a new combination of the atoms and
cells, of which it is composed. The forces and motions,
which assemble and group these atoms and cells
into the chemical combinations and mechanical arrangements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
which build up a body, are new, unique
and peculiar to that body.</p>

<p>The theory of heredity is based on these facts:
The father contributes the spermatozoön and the
mother the ovum, which form the germ-cell; this cell
and its daughter-cells develop and grow to be a man or
a woman, who has substantially the same form, size,
structure, organs and parts that one of its parents
has, and generally has some of their qualities, characteristics
and traits.</p>

<p>But these facts do not prove that the child inherits
anything from either parent; they do not prove
that the parents, or either of them, caused the child
to develop, grow and resemble them in any of these
particulars. The existence of a fact and the cause of
that fact are two different things. Thus, every body
knows that a stone falls to the ground; but nobody
knows why. The child resembles its father&mdash;but why?
Do the parents cause this resemblance? Can they,
or either of them, cause their child to have blue eyes
or black; a long or short nose; a large or small foot?</p>

<p>Neither Darwin, nor any other man has ever
shown how it is possible for the bodies of the parents,
or any part of either of them, to affect, modify or determine
the form, features, size, structure, qualities,
characteristics or traits of their children. It is admitted
on all sides that the parents have no voluntary
control over these things. Darwin, (Origin of Species,
1, p. 15), says: “The laws governing inheritance are
for the most part unknown.” Haeckel is voluminous
in describing the phenomena of reproduction, heredity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
etc. But has nothing to say about the cause, nor
the mechanism of heredity.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly true that the human body is a
compound physical structure; that each organ and
part of every such body has to be made, anew, of
fresh materials, for that body; that the child does
not “take over,” bodily, any organ nor part of either
parent, but has its own new organs, unique and peculiar
to itself; that neither the father nor the mother
has any voluntary power to select, assemble nor group
the atoms and cells, of which the embryo body is made;
nor to generate, guide, nor control the forces and motions
by which this work is done. All this being true,
how is it possible for the parents, or either of them,
to transmit any of their qualities, characteristics or
traits to their child?</p>

<p>The notion of mankind in general appears to be
the body of the child is a sort of offshoot or branch of
the bodies of the parents, as if the child had budded
out on the trunk of the mother; and finally dropped
off and become a distinct individual. But this view
is wholly erroneous. The embryo becomes a separate
and distinct entity the moment the germ-cell is
formed; and it develops and grows, anew, for itself
independently of the bodies of its parents, which have
no more to do with its development and growth than
the body of any other person has.</p>

<p>If we assume that each human being is a new
direct and special creation by Almighty God, we can
readily understand the mysterious phenomena called
“heredity.”</p>

<p>At first, the germ-cell does not resemble either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
parent nor even a human being, it being too small,
even to suggest a human body, at all. An infant at
birth, is too rudimentary to resemble either parent
more closely than it does any other person of the same
sex.</p>

<p>Whether the germ-cell and its daughter-cells are
to develop and grow to be a man, resembling its
father; or a woman resembling its mother, the same
forces and motions are required to assemble and group
the necessary atoms and cells into the proper chemical
combinations and mechanical arrangements in order
to construct its body. The fact that the child may
resemble its father or its mother or both of them, does
not dispense with the assembling of the atoms and
cells; nor with the grouping of them into the necessary
combination and arrangements. It is clear that the
same or similar forces and motions are necessary to
construct any animal body, whatever its form, size
or sex may be.</p>

<p>According to the evolutionist and materialist, the
fact that the child resembles its parents is adequate
to account for, and explain all the phenomena of reproduction.
But the existence of this resemblance,
and, the cause of it, are two wholly different things.
The fact that the child resembles its parents only
deepens the mystery; for it would require less knowledge,
skill and creative force to construct a body with
the qualities and characteristics of mankind in general,
than it would to group the atoms and cells of the
body in such a manner as to produce a body in the
image of a particular man or woman. Thus a portrait
painter could make a fancy sketch of an imaginary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
person, without any striking features, more
easily than he could paint a particular man with all
his peculiarities; as, for example, his bald head, high
forehead, blue eyes, long aquiline nose, wide mouth,
massive lower jaw and tall, slender body. The closer
the resemblance, between the child and its parents, the
greater the mystery.</p>

<p>It being a fact that the body of the child has
identically the same organs and parts that are formed
in the body of its father, or in that of the mother; and
that the child closely resembles one or both of them,
we naturally inquire: “What force or agency causes
the germ-cell and its daughter-cells to develop and
grow until they become a man, like its father; or a
woman like its mother?” We cannot even imagine that
this sameness of organs and parts, of structure, form
and size, and this close resemblance happens by chance
or accident.</p>

<p>Every man has conscious knowledge that he had
no voluntary part in the production of his child, except
that he placed the spermatozoön at a point from
which it could reach the ovum. The mother knows
that she had no voluntary part nor agency in the production
of her child except that she permitted the
father to place the spermatozoön in reach of the ovum.
Neither of them has any voluntary power, nor any
control over the formation of the spermatozoön nor of
the ovum; nor over the development and growth of
the child, nor over its structure, form, size nor over
its features.</p>

<p>The spermatozoön is a microscopic cell, 1/500th
of an inch in length, (Martin, Human Body, p. 651),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the head, which is the largest part of it, being, apparently
about 1/10,000th of an inch in diameter, (Haeckel,
Evolution of Man, p. 53, fig. 22.) It consists of a
homogeneous mass of protoplasm, composed of carbon,
hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen; and sometimes has a
trace of phosphorus and sulphur. (Cent. Dic. 6, p.
4799; Huxley, Anat. Invert. An., pp. 9, 14.) See <a href="#Index">index</a>
infra, “Spermatozoön.” Although the spermatozoön
is not visible to the naked eye, and has certain vital
properties and potentialities, yet it is a physical body
with all the attributes of a brick or stone.</p>

<p>If any quality, characteristic or trait of the father
passes from him to his child, it is transmitted by, and
through the spermatozoön, for that is the only thing
that passes from the one to the other. So, if any
quality, characteristic or trait of the mother passes
from her to her child, it is transmitted by and through
the ovum, that being the only thing that passes from
her to it.</p>

<p>Whatever power or influence the father’s body,
or any organ or part of it, may have to affect or modify
the body of his child or any part of it, must be effected
by and through the spermatozoön before it leaves his
genital organs; for it is clear that neither the father’s
body, nor any organ nor part of it, has any power to
affect, modify or differentiate the spermatozoön, nor
any part of it, after it leaves his body.</p>

<p>It is absurd to suppose that the father’s body, or
any organ or part of it, can affect, modify or differentiate
the spermatozoön, or any part of it, in such
a manner that it shall cause the child to have qualities,
characteristics and traits resembling those of the father.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
In fact he could not possibly know whether there
is one, many, or none in his genital organs, at any
given time, for a stronger reason no single organ nor
any part of his body could possibly affect, modify nor
differentiate the spermatozoön in such a manner as
to cause the child, which arises from it to have organs
and parts resembling those of the father. Thus,
suppose the father has blue eyes. How could the
father, or his eyes, possibly affect the spermatozoön
in such a way as to cause the child’s eyes to be blue?
How could the father, or his nose, modify the spermatozoön
in such a manner as to cause the child’s nose
to resemble the father’s nose. It would be absurd
to suppose that the father’s brain and his vocal organs
can affect the spermatozoön in such a manner as to
cause the child to be a notable singer.</p>

<p>Professor Weismann says:</p>

<p>“It is well known that many mental and physical
qualities of parents are transmitted to their children,
such as the color of the eyes and hair, the shape
and size of the finger nails; and not only these, but
as everyone knows, even such minute and indefinable
physical and mental characteristics as likeness of
features, bearing, gait, handwriting, a mild and equable
or passionate and irritable temperament.”&mdash;(Weismann
on Heredity, 2, p. 14.)</p>

<p>The color of the eyes depends on the coloring
matter or pigment in the irises. How could the father’s
eyes possibly affect the spermatozoön in such a
manner as to make the child’s eyes blue? How could
the father’s red hair differentiate the spermatozoön
so as to give the child red hair? Can we imagine that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the father’s finger nails can affect the spermatozoön
in such a way as to make the child’s nails of the same
“shape and size” as those of the father? How could
such a thing be? Can we believe that a man’s brain,
nerves and muscles, can so affect the spermatozoön
that the child’s handwriting shall be like that of the
father? How could this be? How could the father’s
brain modify the spermatozoön in such sort that the
child shall have the same temperament that the father
has?</p>

<p>Most of the resemblances between the child and
its parents result from education, association and
environment. If a child’s parents die when it is six
months old; and it be placed in the hands of a
stranger and his wife; it is easy to see that many
of the child’s qualities, characteristics and traits
would be borrowed from the man and his wife with
whom the orphan lives.</p>

<p>The infant, at birth, is merely a living creature
without any physical qualities, characteristics or
traits peculiar to itself; nor has it any mental qualities,
characteristics nor traits, whatever. In fact, it
has scarcely any intellect, at all. It follows that most
of the physical qualities and characteristics of each
person are acquired; and that all of the mental qualities,
characteristics and traits of every one are acquired,
they being the result of education, association
and environment. No doubt most of the resemblance
between a child and its parents are caused by education,
imitation and association.</p>

<p>The evolutionist has invented divers theories to
account for, and explain the phenomena of reproduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
on material and mechanical principles, without
the aid of any supernatural psychic or creative force.
For example, Darwin invented the theory of “gemmules”
and “pangenesis;” Spencer advanced the
hypothesis of “physiological units” or “constitutional
units,” “structural proclivity,” or “proclivity
towards the organic form of the species;” Cope suggested
“bathmism (go-ism)” “simple growth-force,”
“grade-growth-force” and “excess-growth;” Weismann
invented the “continuity of germ-plasm,” “ids,”
“iddants” and “determinants.” But none of these
words or phrases explain anything. If there is anything
in nature corresponding to these words none of
these writers ever saw them, nor did they know anything
about them. These “gemmules,” “units,”
“proclivities,” “ids,” “bathmisms,” etc., are purely
hypothetical&mdash;mere figments of the imagination.
Every body has rejected Darwin’s theory of “gemmules,”
and “pangenesis;” no one but Spencer ever
adopted his hypothesis of “physiological units” and
“proclivities;” Cope was the only man that over used
“bathmism,” etc.; Spencer, Romanes and others gave
many reasons why Weismann’s “continuity of germ-plasm,”
“ids,” “iddants” and “determinants” were
absurd and impossible. No two of them agreed on
anything, except the supposed fact of organic evolution.
Spencer, somewhere says, in substance, that
there is a general belief that organic evolution has
occurred; but great diversity of opinion as to the manner
in which it has been effected.</p>

<p>The theory of the evolutionist is that the genital
organs of a man generate spermatozoä, with all their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
properties and potentialities, spontaneously and automatically,
without the aid of any extraneous, psychic
or creative force, and that those of a woman produce
ova in the same manner. He maintains that a
spermatozoön and an ovum unite and fuse into a
germ-cell (fertilized ovum) and that this cell (germ)
then becomes, automatically, a living being; that it
develops and grows spontaneously and automatically,
to be a man or a woman, without the aid or guidance
of any extraneous psychic or creative force, whatever.</p>

<p>As a fact the fertilized ovum does not develop into
a man or woman at all, but a vast number of daughter-cells
are produced from it, which are metamorphosed
and molded by the Creator into a man or woman.
The evolutionist holds that the fertilized ovum inherits
all its properties and potentialities from its parents.
In other words, he contends that the germ-cell
develops and grows as it does because its father and
mother developed and grew in the same manner. Is
there any apparent reason why the germ-cell should
develop and grow at all? Why should it develop and
grow, spontaneously and automatically, as its father
and mother grew? The germ-cell is a new combination
of the atoms of which it is composed; the embryo
is built up of new materials; wholly different from
those which compose the bodies of its parents; and by
new forces and motions, altogether different from
those which built up the bodies of its parents. How
could the mode, in which the bodies of the father and
mother developed and grew, possibly affect the development
and growth of the child?</p>

<p>The fact that each normal body develops and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
grows in the same manner that the bodies of its parents
grew, and as every other normal body grows, is
conclusive evidence that the development and growth
of each human body is caused, guided and controlled
by an extraneous supernatural psychic and creative
force, which is ubiquitous, all over the earth. No
other hypothesis can explain the uniform mode of
development and growth, which we observe, among
all the mammals in every age and country.</p>

<p>The fact that the child resembles its father or
mother, or both of them, is strong evidence that the
same creative force made all three of them. We cannot
believe that the blind, unthinking cells, which
build up the body of the child, automatically, group
themselves in such a manner as to make the child in
the image of the father or mother.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that each human body is built
of atoms and cells, which are assembled and grouped
into certain chemical combinations and mechanical
arrangements by force and motion, and that there cannot
be any such thing as force and motion without, at
least two physical bodies, the one to transmit the force
and the other to move. The word, “heredity,” does
not denote a physical body nor a physical force. It
is a mere name for a group of vital phenomena. How
could heredity bring two or more atoms or cells together?
Such a suggestion is too absurd even for the
imagination.</p>

<p>Perhaps the orthodox churchman would maintain
that the Creator endowed Adam’s genital organs
with the power to generate spermatozoä; and also
endowed those of Eve with the power to produce ova;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
that He endowed these spermatozoä and ova with the
power to produce new men and woman, automatically;
and that He ordained that they should have the
power to produce new spermatozoä and new ova, with
the same properties and potentialities that were possessed
by the original spermatozoä and ova, that were
generated in the bodies of Adam and Eve and so on
forever.</p>

<p>This brings us back to the proposition that every
human body is a compound physical structure, composed
of atoms and cells, which are grouped into certain
chemical combinations and mechanical arrangements;
and that intellect, memory, will-power, force
and motion are necessary to make these combinations
and arrangements. To do this work, automatically,
these atoms and cells must be endowed with divine
intellect, memory, will-power and creative force; and
this is equivalent to a special creation. So if it be
said that each fertilized ovum is endowed with the
power to produce a new man or woman, the answer
is that this endowment is equivalent to a special
creation.</p>

<p>The reader may argue that the Creator endowed
Adam’s spermatozoä and Eve’s ova with the power
to develop men and women, who were endowed with
the power to produce new spermatozoä and new ova,
with the same properties and potentialities that were
possessed by those of Adam and Eve and so on forever
to the nth. generation.</p>

<p>There are several insuperable objections to this
theory:</p>

<p><i>First.</i>&mdash;It is inconceivable that a man could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
endowed with the power to produce spermatozoä before
he is born; nor could a woman produce ova before
her birth; nor is it possible to endow a fertilized
ovum with the power to produce a man or woman before
it is formed. When Adam’s spermatozoä and
Eve’s ova were made the men and women to be produced
from them had not come into being; and it was
impossible for even the Creator to endow them, at
that time, with the power to produce spermatozoä and
ova. Intellect, memory, will-power, force and motion
were necessary to group the atoms and cells of which
the bodies of these new men and women were to be
composed, into the necessary chemical combinations
and mechanical arrangements in order to construct
their bodies. Neither the spermatozoä, the ova nor the
germ-cells produced from them, had intellect, memory,
will-power nor the necessary force. Therefore
it was impossible for Adam’s spermatozoä and Eve’s
ova, or germ-cell, resulting from their fusion, to produce
Adam and Eve’s children, automatically.</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i>&mdash;Neither the children of Adam and
Eve nor of any other man or woman ever had the
power to generate spermatozoä and ova, voluntarily.
It is inconceivable that the blind unthinking genital
organs of Adam’s children or of any other
man or woman ever produced spermatozoä and
ova spontaneously and automatically. We are
compelled to believe that the Creator always
generates, guides and controls the forces and motions
which assemble and group the atoms into the form of
the spermatozoä and ova; and that he directly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
specially endows each spermatozoön and ovum with
such properties and potentialities as it may possess.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly.</i>&mdash;Life is not a property of matter. If
it were, there would be no such thing as death; for
matter and all its attributes and properties are eternal.
The atoms, of which a man’s body is composed,
are as old as the earth. But during his life, they are
grouped together; and this group of atoms is endowed
with the properties and potentials of a living being.
The human body has identically the same physical
properties, whether it be living or dead. Thus, it has
the same weight, length, breadth and thickness after
death that it had while living, until disintegration
sets in. Apparently, the living human body is similar
to a piece of iron, when charged with electricity or
magnetism. Neither of these adds anything to the
weight of the iron; nor do they change its structure,
form, size, nor its appearance. When they leave the
iron it remains as it was before it was charged with
them. So it is with the human body for a time after
life leaves it.</p>

<p>Life not being a property of matter, it must be
directly and specially conferred, by a supernatural
creative force, upon the body in which it resides.</p>

<p>It is agreed by all biologists that there is no such
thing as spontaneous generation of animals, nor of
plants at this time. As Huxley puts it: “<i>Omne
vivum ex vivo</i>,” “all life comes of life.” (Encyc.
Brit. (9 ed.) 8, p. 746.)</p>

<p>Now, if there be no such thing as spontaneous
generation of animals, nor of plants, why should there
be spontaneous generation of life? Neither the spermatozoön,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
nor the ovum can live alone. But when
united and fused together, under proper conditions,
this combination takes on the manifestations of life;
and these manifestations continue until death.</p>

<p>Any good chemist can analyze a fertilized ovum
and learn, exactly, the chemical elements of which it
is composed, and the proportions in which they are
combined. He could then make a new combination of
carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen in the same
proportions, in which these substances were combined
in the fertilized ovum; and if life were a property of
that combination of atoms, this new chemical compound,
ought to become a living creature. But no
such thing could ever happen.</p>

<p>As already remarked, neither the spermatozoön
nor the ovum can live alone. But when fused together,
the combination becomes a living creature. The
atoms in the combination are identically the same
that were in the spermatozoön and ovum before the
fusion occurred. Why should the combination live
when the two component parts of it could not?</p>

<p>It is clear that no man can, voluntarily
nor involuntarily endow a spermatozoön with
the power to develop, alone, into a human
being; for every one of them dies in a day, or
within a few days, after it matures; unless it be so
fortunate as to unite and fuse with an ovum. It is
equally clear that no woman can endow an ovum with
the power to become a human being. Every ovum
soon dies, unless it unite and fuse with a spermatozoön
under conditions favorable to growth. Haeckel says:
“there are calculated to be 72,000 [ova] in the sexually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
mature maiden.” (Evolution of Man, p. 347.)
The number of spermatozoä, generated in the sexual
organs of a man greatly exceeds the number of ova
produced by a woman. It follows that countless trillions
of spermatozoä and ova die daily, and disintegrate.</p>

<p>Now, if no man can endow a spermatozoön with
the power to develop into a new human being; and
if no woman can endow an ovum with power to do so;
how is it possible for either parent to endow the fertilized
ovum with that power, when it is no part of
the body of either of them?</p>

<p>But the evolutionist maintains that the child has
in fact, many of the qualities, characteristics and
traits, both physical and mental, of its parents; that
the parents transmit these qualities, characteristics
and traits, to their child, by and through the spermatozoön
and the ovum; that this is the only means
by which the child could acquire the qualities, characteristics
and traits of its parents. Hence, the evolutionist
infers that heredity is based on the physical
qualities and properties of the spermatozoön and
ovum.</p>

<p>But, as I have already argued (Sec. 15) the
spermatozoön and the ovum are, themselves, new, direct
and special creations, and so is the embryo body.
While the physical qualities and characteristics of the
spermatozoön may affect the body and mind of the
child, to some extent; yet the child remains a new,
direct and special creation.</p>

<p>Neither Darwin, nor any other man, has ever
shown how it is possible for the father, his body or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
any part of it, to impress, modify or affect the spermatozoön,
or any part of it, in such a manner as to
cause the child to resemble him in any particular;
nor has it been shown how it is possible for the mother,
her body or any part of it, to impress, modify
or affect the ovum, or any part of it, in such a manner
as to cause the child to resemble her. When we
consider the great number of spermatozoä and ova
that are produced; their small sizes and short lives;
their location in the genital organs; and the lack of
intellect, memory and will-power in every organ and
part of the bodies of the parents, and the fact that
the “gemmules” must reach the spermatozoön and
the ovum through the blood, we are compelled to believe
that it is impossible for the spermatozoön and
ovum to transmit, unaided and alone, any quality,
characteristic or trait of a parent to the child; and
we are forced to infer that the Creator, directly and
specially, endows the spermatozoön and ovum with
power to convey to the child such qualities, characteristics,
and traits of its parents as they do, in fact,
carry to it.</p>

<p>Assuming for argument that certain qualities,
characteristics and traits of the father and mother
are transmitted to the child by and through the spermatozoön
and ovum; this fact does not militate against
my theory of special Creation; for it seems reasonable
to suppose that the spermatozoön and ovum are specially
endowed by the Creator, with such powers and
potentialities as they possess. Moreover, the evolutionist
and materialist are in this attitude; they cannot
show how it is possible for the germ-cell (composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of the spermatozoön and ovum) to produce, unaided
and alone, a child with the qualities, characteristics
and traits of its parents; nor can they prove
that the germ-cell and its daughter-cells do, in fact,
automatically, produce the child without the aid of the
Creator.</p>

<p>Assuming for argument that the spermatozoön,
ovum, germ-cell and its daughter-cells appear to do
automatically all the wonderful things that the evolutionist
and materialist say they do, the question remains:
do these senseless, unthinking atoms and cells,
spontaneously and automatically build up the embryo
body with all its organs and parts, or does the Creator,
in fact, generate, guide and control the forces
and motions, which group these cells into the embryo
body? In other words: when the atoms and cells,
which go to build up the embryo body, appear to act
spontaneously and automatically, are they, in fact,
moved, guided, controlled and grouped into the form
of the embryo body by the Creator?</p>

<p>The facts in relation to the development and
growth of the embryo are easily described and understood.
But the real question is this: “What force
or agency causes this development and growth?”</p>

<p>What force or agency causes the child to resemble
its parents? Do the germ-cell and its daughter-cells
spontaneously and automatically cause this resemblance;
or does the Creator cause it?</p>

<p>Referring to the origin of life in the individual,
Professor Martin says:</p>

<p>“At present we know nothing in physiology answering
to the match which lights the furnace; those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
manifestations of energy we call life are handed down
from generation to generation, as sacred fire in the
temple of vesta from one watcher to another. Science
may at some time teach us how to bring the chemical
constituents of protoplasm into that combination in
which they possess the faculty of starting the oxidations
under those conditions which characterize life;
then we shall have learnt to strike the vital match.”
(Martin, Human Body, p. 312.)</p>

<p>I do not believe that life is handed down from
generation to generation. On the contrary the Creator
strikes “the vital match” when each fertilized
ovum is formed; and every such human ovum is
directly and specially endowed by the Creator, with
the power to develop into a man or woman.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec32">Sec. 32. Nature has no Power to Generate
a New Human Being; nor to
Evolve one from the Germ-Cell</h2>

<p>Nature is defined as: “The forces or processes
of the material world conceived of as an agency intermediate
between the Creator and the world, producing
all organisms and preserving the regular order
of things; as in the old dictum, ‘nature abhors a
vacuum.’ In this sense, <i>nature</i> is often personified.”
(Cent. Dic. 5, p. 3943.) It follows that “nature”
is not a substantial nor a material entity or thing,
like a man, a tree, or a stone; but is only a name for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
certain real or imaginary “forces or processes.” The
word does not indicate by what agency these “forces
or processes” are generated, guided nor controlled.
But we use the word to indicate or describe certain
phenomena, which we do not understand, in the same
manner that we use the word “gravitation.”</p>

<p>The naturalist or materialist would say that nature
generates the spermatozoön and ovum; that it
unites and fuses them into the germ-cell; and that it
develops this cell into a man or woman. One might
as well say, historically, that the spermatozoön and
ovum are generated and fused; and that a man or
woman is produced from it. But this statement does
not explain anything. It does not tell us what force
selects, assembles and groups the atoms into the spermatozoön
and ovum; nor what endows it with life; nor
who nor what creates its soul; nor what force or
agency causes the embryo to develop and grow to manhood
or womanhood.</p>

<p>To say that “nature” generates and evolves new
men and women, is no explanation of the phenomena
of reproduction. Nature has no physical body, no
weight, length, breadth, nor thickness, no intellect,
memory nor will-power; nor can it voluntarily generate
force nor motion. It follows that “nature” cannot
form the spermatozoön nor the ovum; cannot cause
them to unite and fuse into a germ-cell; nor cause the
necessary atoms and cells to assemble and group themselves
into the chemical combinations and mechanical
arrangements required to build up the embryo body,
its organs and parts.</p>

<p>In other words, “nature” works by and through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the spermatozoön, the ovum and germ-cell or fertilized
ovum. It has identically the same powers and potentialities
that they have&mdash;no more nor less. It follows
that nature cannot, automatically, generate nor
evolve, a new man, nor a new woman.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec33">Sec. 33. Every Human Being is a New,
Direct and Special Creation by Almighty
God; this Question to
be Determined, How</h2>

<p>To determine this question it is necessary: <i>first</i>,
to ascertain what work has to be done in order to create
a new human being; <i>secondly</i>, to consider whether
this work can be done, spontaneously and automatically,
by the germ-cell or fertilized ovum and its
daughter-cells, or whether a supernatural psychic and
creative force is necessary to do it.</p>

<p>Darwin ought to be accepted by the evolutionist
and materialist as high authority on any biological
question, and specially on the subject of special creation.
I call him as my first witness. In his Origin of
Species, last edition, 1872, (vol. 2, p. 298) he says:</p>

<p>“I believe that [all] animals are descended from
at most only four or five progenitors, and plants from
an equal or lesser number. Analogy would lead one
step further, namely, to the belief that all animals
and plants are descended from some one prototype.”</p>

<p>Again, on page 299, he says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“If we admit this, we must likewise admit that
all the organic beings, which have ever lived on this
earth may have descended from one primordial form.”</p>

<p>The last ten lines in his Origin of Species (vol.
2, pp. 305-306) are in these words:</p>

<p>“Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and
death, the most exalted object which we are capable
of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher
animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this
view of life, with its several powers having been originally
breathed by the Creator into a few forms, or
into one, and that whilst this planet has gone cycling
on, according to the fixed law of gravity, from so
simple a beginning, endless forms most beautiful and
most wonderful, have been and are being evolved.”</p>

<p>Thus, the reader will see that Darwin, himself
believed that the first one, or the first few, animals
and plants were directly and specially created by Almighty
God.</p>

<p>I base the theory that every Human being is
a new, direct and special creation by Almighty God,
on the following propositions:</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec34">Sec. 34. Proposition 1. Animals and Plants
First Appeared on the Earth
at a Certain Time</h2>

<p>There was a time when there were no animals,
nor plants on our planet. Therefore, they must have
appeared at a definite period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>The rocks tell us that animals and plants first
appeared on the earth in the archæozoic or primordial
geological age, which, according to Haeckel, began
100,300,000 years ago. (Last words on Evolution,
p. 165.) He also says that “life began to exist
at a definite period,” “on our planet;” that
“no organism can exist or discharge its functions
without water. No water, no life!” and that the
surface of the earth had to cool down so as to convert
“the envelope of steam into water” before animals
and plants could live. (Evolution of Man, p. 200.)</p>

<h2 id="sec35">Sec. 35. Proposition 2. First Animal and
Plant were Either Specially Created;
or Arose by Spontaneous Generation
from Inorganic
Matter</h2>

<p>Mysterious and miraculous as it may seem, animals
and plants have lived on the earth during this
eternity of time. The earth is now covered with
countless millions of them. We know that we, ourselves,
are here. How did they happen to be here?
How did we get here? How did life originate on the
earth?</p>

<p>It is obvious that the first animal or plant that
appeared on the earth was either directly and specially
made, by a supernatural psychic and creative force,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of inorganic matter; or that it arose, by spontaneous
generation, from such matter; for it must necessarily
have originated in the one manner or in the other.
How else could it have come into existence?</p>

<p>So far as I know, there are only two theories,
among educated and scientific men, as to the origin
of animals and plants. The one is that they were
directly and specially made by the Creator; the other
is that they arose by spontaneous generation, from
inorganic matter. Which of these is most plausible?
(Spencer, Principles of Biology, vol. 1, pp. 415-416.)</p>

<p>The evolutionist and materialist maintain that
the course of nature is “uniform, continuous and
everlasting;” that the earth is now behaving identically,
as it has been ever since it came into existence;
that animals and plants are now being evolved, as
in the past, while others are becoming extinct, and
that every animal and plant is merely a co-ordinated
term in natures “great progression.” (Huxley, Man’s
Place in Nature, p. 151.)</p>

<p>According to this view, if an animal or a plant
was ever spontaneously generated from inorganic
matter, we would naturally expect to find them arising
in the same manner today, for there is no reason to
suppose that the nature of the “inorganic matter,”
which they say produced the first animal or plant, has
been exhausted; nor that it has changed; nor that the
conditions have changed, nor that the forces which
are supposed to have caused the spontaneous generation
of the first animal and plant have ceased to exist.</p>

<h2 id="sec36">Sec. 36. Proposition 3. No Spontaneous
Generation of Animals; nor of Plants</h2>

<p>Professor Huxley (1825-1905) was a scientist
and philosopher of the first magnitude. He was an
intimate friend to Darwin; an evolutionist and materialist
of the strictest sect and fully competent to
speak for these schools of philosophy. Among other
works on evolution, he wrote, “Man’s Place in Nature”
(1863), in which he argued at great length that
man is a descendant of an ape. Hence the following
quotations from his works may be taken as authoritative
admissions on the part of the evolutionist and
materialist.</p>

<p>He says:</p>

<p>“The fact is that at the present moment there is
not a shadow of trustworthy direct evidence that
abiogenesis [spontaneous generation] does take place,
or has taken place, within the period during which
the existence of life on the globe is recorded.” (Huxley,
Anat. Invert. An., pp. 40-41.)</p>

<p>Writing in the Encyclopedia Britannica (9 ed.,
vol. 8, p. 746) he says, in substance, that the aphorism:
“omne vivum ex vivo” (“all life comes of life”)
is a “well established law of the existing course of nature.”</p>

<p>The theory of spontaneous generation assumes
that certain inorganic elements, spontaneously and
automatically grouped themselves together in such
proportions and in such a manner, chemically and mechanically,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
as to produce one or a very few animals
or plants; and that all other animals and plants have
descended from this one, or these few primordial
forms. No one pretends to say that there is any direct
evidence that any such thing ever happened. On the
contrary every fact within our knowledge tends to
negative the theory of spontaneous generation. But,
in order to dispense with the theory of special creation,
the evolutionist and materialist invented the theory
of spontaneous generation. There is not only no evidence
to support the theory of spontaneous generation,
but after many trials scientific men have wholly
failed to produce any living substance, whatever. On
this point Professor Huxley says:</p>

<p>“To enable us to say that we know anything about
the experimental origination of organization and life,
the investigator ought to be able to take inorganic
matters, such as carbonic acid, ammonia, water and
salines, in any sort of inorganic combination, and be
able to build them up into protein matter [nitrogenous
or albuminoid bodies] and that protein matter
ought to begin to live in an organic form. That, nobody
has done as yet; and I suspect it will be a long
while before anybody does it.” (Huxley, Origin of
Species, p. 69.) After discussing the theory of spontaneous
generation at length, and describing the experiments
which are supposed to have destroyed that
theory, he says:</p>

<p>“For my part, I conceive that with the particulars
of M. Pasteur’s experiments before us, we cannot
fail to arrive at his conclusions; and that the doctrine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
of spontaneous generation has received a final <i>coup
de grace</i>” [stroke of mercy or death blow.]</p>

<p>After describing the experiments of a number of
scientists the New International Encyclopedia, published
in 1905, (vol. 1, p. 463) says:</p>

<p>“The result of these experiments and conclusions
is that the view that spontaneous generation takes
place at the present day, has been entirely discarded.”</p>

<p>If there was ever any such thing as spontaneous
generation of animals and plants, from inorganic matter,
why should it not continue to happen, down to
the present time?</p>

<p>We are therefore compelled to believe that there
never was any such thing as spontaneous generation
from inorganic matters; and we know that all the
men of the earth, acting in concert, could not produce
a single live worm!</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec37">Sec. 37. Proposition 4. Creator Could
Have Made a Million Animals or
Plants as Well as One</h2>

<p>If it be admitted, as Darwin does, that the Creator
made “one or a few” animals and plants, in the
beginning, we may well suppose that He could have
made a million, or a million of millions, as easily as
one.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="sec38">Sec. 38. Proposition 5. If the Creator
Made the First Animal and the First
Plant He Made All Others</h2>

<p>If it be admitted that He created the first one,
or the first few, animals and plants, why should we
doubt that He created all of them? If He began to
create them, why should He cease to do so? His works
are uniform, continuous and everlasting.</p>

<p>But in his “Origin of Species” (vol. 2, p. 304-305)
Darwin says:</p>

<p>“Authors of the highest eminence seem to be
fully satisfied with the view that each species has been
independently created. To my mind it accords better
with what we know of the laws impressed on matter
by the Creator, that the production and extinction of
the past and present inhabitants of the world should
have been due to secondary causes, like those determining
the birth and death of the individual.”</p>

<p>What are “the laws impressed on matter by the
Creator,” that have anything to do with the reproduction
of animals and plants? What laws “impressed
on matter” have any bearing on the question
whether animals and plants have arisen from inorganic
matter, by spontaneous generation or by special
creation? Perhaps Darwin means to say that he
supposes the Creator would naturally make one or a
few primordial forms of animal and plant and turn
them loose upon the earth to shift for themselves subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to “secondary causes,” namely, the factors of
evolution. But he does not profess to have any special
knowledge of the Divine Mind; nor does he pretend
to know more of it than any other man does.</p>

<p>Perhaps Lamarck (1744-1829) was the first to
suggest the theory of spontaneous generation, in the
sense in which these words are now used, and the
evolution of species. (Encyclopedia Britannica 14,
p. 232.) Down to his time, no one doubted the
Mosaic story of the creation. Belief in the theory of
special creation was well nigh universal down to the
publication of Darwin’s Origin of Species, in 1859.
This belief was shared alike by both scientists and
laymen. But shortly after the publication of that
work, belief in the theory of organic evolution became
a fad among educated people; and that belief was
supposed to indicate intellectual power and independence
of thought.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec39">Sec. 39. Proposition 6. Human Body is
Either Specially Created or Spontaneously
Generated, Which?</h2>

<p>According to the evolutionist and materialist, the
reproduction of the human body from a fertilized
ovum is, in substance and effect, the same thing as
spontaneous generation of such a body from inorganic
matter. The work to be done in the one case is identically
the same as that to be done in the other. In fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the spermatozoön and the ovum are made of dead matter;
and if we consider the making of the spermatozoön
and the ovum as the first steps in the process of reproduction
as they are; and also assume that the Creator
takes no part in that process, we would then have
to say that the human body arises by spontaneous generation
from inorganic matter; for it is undoubtedly
true that the spermatozoön and ovum are made of inorganic
substances, namely: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen
and oxygen. It is equally true that the fertilized
ovum has no more intellect, memory nor will-power
than its component atoms of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen
and oxygen had; nor has it any more power to
generate, guide and control forces and motions than
they had. It follows that the same psychic and creative
force is necessary to produce a new human being
whether it be made from a germ of inorganic matter
or from a fertilized ovum; the ovum being only one
remove from inorganic matter. Moreover, the entire
human body is made of dead matter except the infinitesimal
fertilized ovum.</p>

<p>There is no middle ground between special creation
on the one side and spontaneous generation on
the other; either the Creator generates, guides and
controls the forces and motions which build up the
embryo body, its organs and parts; or the atoms and
cells, of which they are made, do, spontaneously and
automatically, assemble and group themselves into the
chemical combinations, and into the mechanical arrangements,
which are necessary to make them.</p>

<p>The reader may argue that “nature,” “heredity”
or the germ-cell (fertilized ovum) does this wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
work of building up the embryo body; and, therefore,
that neither the Creator nor spontaneous generation
does it. But “nature” and “heredity” do all
their work by and through the germ-cell; so their
powers are identical with those of the germ-cell. This
germ is a tiny bit of protoplasm composed of carbon,
hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen, with a possible trace
of sulphur and phosphorus. It has no brain, eyes,
ears, nose, touch, nor taste; no intellect, memory, nor
will-power; no knowledge of anatomy, chemical elements,
chemical affinity, form, size, time, nor space;
nor any constructive power nor force; has no power
to generate forces nor to guide and control motions.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is impossible for the germ-cell, or
its daughter-cells, to build up, automatically, the embryo
body, with all its organs and parts. It follows
that this body must be directly and specially created
by Almighty God.</p>

<p>Again, every embryo body is made of cells (organic
bricks) and these are made of dead atoms. In order
to construct this body it is necessary to group a certain
number of these atoms into certain chemical combinations;
next these combinations must be grouped
into certain mechanical arrangements. Thus, the skeleton
is made of bones; they are made of cells, which in
turn are made of dead atoms of lime, carbon, phosphorus,
etc.; these cells must be grouped into phosphate
of lime, carbonate of lime, gelatin, etc. These
combinations must then be grouped into the two hundred
and seventy-eight bones of the embryo skeleton,
giving each bone its proper form, size, structure and
place in the skeleton. It is clear that neither the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
father nor the mother takes any part in making these
chemical combinations nor in making the mechanical
arrangements. It is equally clear that they are not
made by chance nor by accident; nor by the “factors”
of evolution.</p>

<p>It follows that the atoms and cells of which the
embryo body is made, do, spontaneously and automatically
group themselves into the chemical combinations
and mechanical arrangements, which are
necessary to construct the several organs and parts of
the embryo body without the aid or guidance of any
extraneous psychic or creative force; or that every
organ and part of the embryo body is directly and
specially made by the Creator.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec40">Sec. 40. Proposition 7. Human Skeleton
is a Special Creation</h2>

<p>Human bones are composed of ten chemical elements,
namely: carbon, chlorin, hydrogen, lime, magnesium,
nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sodium and sulphur.
As found in the bones, these elements are
grouped into the five chemical combinations, following:
phosphate of lime, carbonate of lime, carbonate of
soda, chloride of soda, and gelatin.</p>

<p>There are eight bones in the cranium, fourteen in
the face and six in the ears, making twenty-eight in
the skull, besides the thirty-two teeth. (Encyc. Brit.
(9 ed.) vol. 1, p. 822.) In the infant there are thirty-three
vertebræ (joints) in the spinal column, namely:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
seven cervical, in the neck; twelve dorsal, in the back;
five lumbar, in the small of the back; five sacral, in
the sacrum; and four coccygeal, in the coccyx. But
in the adult, there are only twenty-six, the five sacral
joints having fused into one bone, and the four in the
coccyx having fused into another; these two and the
twenty-four regular vertebræ (joints) making twenty-six.
(Same book, p. 820.) In the chest there are
twelve pairs of ribs, the sternum or breast bone and
the hyoid or tongue bone, twenty-six in all. (Same
book, p. 822.) Each arm and hand, including the
scapula or shoulder blade, consists of thirty-two bones,
making sixty-four in the two arms and hands. In each
leg and foot, including the bones of the pelvis, there
are thirty-one bones, making sixty-two in the pelvis,
legs and feet. So that the adult human skeleton consists
of two hundred and six bones, besides the thirty-two
teeth. (Johnson’s Universal Cyclopedia, 7, p. 553.)</p>

<p>The same book, (p. 533) says:</p>

<p>“At birth their number is 278; at the age of twenty-five,
224; in advanced old age, 194. About 660 segments
are needed in the formation of the 206 bones.”</p>

<p>In another place it says:</p>

<p>“Thus, the thigh bone or femur represents the
fusion of at least five distinct segments, the union not
being fully completed until about the twentieth year.”
(Same book, p. 553, column 1.)</p>

<p>There is no bone in the fertilized ovum; therefore
each skeleton and each bone is produced anew; that
is, it grows anew for itself. No two bones are exactly
alike. In the case of pairs similar bones are on opposite
sides of the body, thus half the ribs, one arm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
hand, leg, and foot are on each side of the body. Each
of the twenty-four regular joints in the spinal column
is similar to every other joint except the atlas. But,
beginning at the top and going downward, each joint
is smaller than the one next below it.</p>

<p>The bones of the skeleton have pores, foraminæ
(holes), cavities, processes, joints and sutures. Some
of them are long, others short, broad and irregular.
Each is attached to one or more other bones by a joint
or a suture. Each is adjusted to, and correlated with
every other, in structure, form, size and function.
The bones in the infant body grow inside of it and
while in the mother’s womb. There is no model
present by which to make it.</p>

<p>Who determines at what points in the embryo
body these two hundred and seventy-eight bones
shall be built up? Who ordains that there shall be
twenty-two in the skull, thirty-three in the spinal
column, etc.? Who fixes the structure, form, and size
of each bone? Who adjusts and correlates each bone
in the skeleton to every other? Who counts them?
Who guides and controls the forces and motions that
build up the skeleton, in such a manner that the bones
on the right side have the same structure, form and
size as those on the left? How does it happen that
the bones on the right side are the reverse of those
on the left? How does it happen that each human
skeleton is exactly like every other. Who fixes nine
months as the time in which the infant skeleton shall
mature sufficiently for birth?</p>

<p>The father contributes the spermatozoön and
the mother the ovum; these two cells fuse into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
germ-cell (fertilized ovum), which is composed of carbon,
hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen, with a possible
trace of phosphorus and sulphur. Whatever qualities,
characteristics, traits and potentialities pass from the
parents to the child must necessarily be transmitted
by and through the germ-cell (or fertilized ovum),
for nothing else passes from the parents to the child.
This cell is about the size of one-sixth of a common
pin’s head; and is barely visible to the naked eye
under the most favorable conditions. It has no intellect,
memory nor will-power; no knowledge of anatomy,
nor of the human body.</p>

<p>It is immediately divided into two daughter-cells,
these into four, eight, sixteen, thirty-two and so on
to infinity. Thus, it appears that the infinitesimal
fertilized ovum is soon disintegrated, divided into
millions of pieces and distributed among the new cells
which are made from the food of the mother.</p>

<p>It is impossible to believe that the minute fertilized
ovum when divided into a million pieces, selects
the atoms, generates, guides and controls the forces
and motions which build up the two hundred and seventy-eight
bones in the infant body. It is preposterous
to suppose that the millionth part of the germ-cell
can determine the point in the embryo body, in which
the skull bones, the ear bones, the spinal column, the
arm-buds, leg-buds, etc., shall appear. Nor can we
believe that this little cell or any of its daughter-cells
can spontaneously and automatically produce any of
the vital phenomena, manifested by the human skeleton.</p>

<p>Every one knows that neither the father nor the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
mother has any voluntary power, nor any control over
the development and growth of the embryo.</p>

<p>Does the embryo develop and grow by accident or
chance? Surely not; for each embryo develops and
grows precisely as every other does, in every age and
country, thus showing that the same ubiquitous creative
force makes all of them.</p>

<p>“We must not assume any original creation, nor
repeated creations,” says Haeckel, “to explain this,
but a natural, continuous and necessary evolution.”
(Evolution of Man, p. 26.) He argues that there is no
personal God.</p>

<p>Writing in the Encyclopedia Britannica (vol.
8, p. 746, 9 ed.) Professor Huxley says:</p>

<p>“No exception is, at this time, known to the general
law, established upon an immense multitude of
direct observations, that every living thing is evolved
from a particle of matter, in which no trace of the
distinctive characters of the adult form of that living
thing is discernible. This particle is termed a <i>germ</i>.…</p>

<p>“The definition of a germ as ‘matter potentially
alive, and having, <i>within itself</i>, the tendency to assume
a definite living form,’ appears to meet all the
requirements of modern science …
And the qualification of ‘potential’ has the advantage
of reminding us that the great characteristic of the
germ is not so much <i>what it is</i>, but <i>what it may, under
suitable conditions, become</i>.…</p>

<p>“In all cases, the process of evolution consists in
a succession of changes of the form, structure and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
functions of the germ by which it passes, step by step,
from an extreme simplicity, or relative homogeneity,
of visible structure to a greater or less degree of complexity
or heterogeneity; and the course of progressive
differentiation is generally accompanied by growth,
which is effected by intussusception,” [interstitial
deposit.]</p>

<p>“… And so far from the fully developed organism’s
being simply the germ <i>plus</i> the nutriment, which it
has absorbed, it is probable that the adult contains
neither in form, nor in substance, more than an inappreciable
fraction of the constituents of the germ, and
that it is almost wholly made up of assimilated and
metamorphosed nutriment.”</p>

<p>This being true, it cannot be said that the germ
(fertilized ovum) ever develops into a man or woman.
On the contrary it is annihilated; and its identity is
wholly lost among the daughter-cells which are made
of the mother’s food.</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer invented what he calls “physiological
units” or “constitutional units,” and “structural
proclivity.” But neither he nor any other man
ever saw one of these “units,” they being wholly imaginary.
In his Principles of Biology (vol. 1, p. 368)
under “Genesis, heredity and variation,” he says:</p>

<p>“So that though all parts are composed of physiological
units of the same nature, yet everywhere, in
virtue of local conditions and the influence of its
neighbors, each unit joins in forming a particular
structure appropriate to its place.”</p>

<p>Could anything be more absurd?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>For Spencer’s view of “physiological units” and
“structural proclivity” see Principles of Biology 1,
pp. 226, 361, 362, 365, 368, 372, and vol. 2, pp. 612-618.</p>

<p>The effect of the above quotations is that the atoms
and cells of which the embryo body is composed, do
spontaneously and automatically assemble and group
themselves into the chemical combinations and mechanical
arrangements, which are necessary to build
up the human body, without the aid of any extraneous
psychic or creative force whatever. This is necessarily
the theory of the evolutionist and materialist; for they
deny that there was ever any such thing as special
creation. Besides, every one knows that neither the
father nor the mother has any power, nor any control
over the development and growth of the embryo.</p>

<p>It follows that the blind, unthinking, fertilized
ovum and daughter-cells arising from it, spontaneously
and automatically assemble themselves together in
the form of the two hundred and seventy-eight bones
of the embryo skeleton; or that the Creator generates,
guides, and controls the forces and motions which
build up the embryo body. Which theory is most
plausible?</p>

<p>We cannot even imagine the dead atoms of carbon,
chlorine, hydrogen, lime, etc., which compose the bones,
assemble and group themselves into the twenty-two
bones of the skull; nor into the thirty-three joints of
the spinal column; nor into the bones of the arms,
hands, legs and feet with all their pores, foraminæ,
cavities, processes, joints and sutures.</p>

<p>But the evolutionist says that “heredity” produces
the embryo; and another says “nature” does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
this wonderful work. I reply that whatever “heredity”
and “nature” may do toward the production of
the embryo must necessarily be done by and through
the fertilized ovum, and I have already argued that
this little atom is powerless to do any such thing.
See <a href="#Index">index</a>, infra, “Heredity.”</p>

<p>Each bone in the skeleton, and all of them as a
whole, testify that they were designed and made by
the Creator!</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec41">Sec. 41. Proposition 8. Each Human Eye
is a New, Direct and Special Creation</h2>

<p>Two new eyes must be made, out and out, for
each embryo.</p>

<p>The eye is formed before birth. This fact makes
it clear that the alleged factors of evolution have nothing
to do with its production.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the father takes no part in the
construction of the child’s eyes; for he contributes the
spermatozoön, only; and the formation of the eye begins
a considerable time after the spermatozoön fuses
with the ovum. It is equally clear that the mother
has no voluntary agency in the production of the
child’s eyes. In brief, the child develops and grows
in the mother’s womb, as a parasite, she being merely
its host. Moreover, the reader will readily admit that
all the scientists on the earth, acting in concert, could
not make a living eye for a toad.</p>

<p>Each human eye has the same parts, the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
construction, form, and substantially the same size
that every other such eye has; and performs the same
functions. So all human eyes occupy the same relative
position in the face. We are, therefore, compelled
to believe that human eyes are not produced by accident
nor by chance; but they develop and grow by
force of a universal law; or that they are made by the
Creator.</p>

<p>But the almost universal belief is that “heredity”
or “nature” causes the child’s eyes to grow, as those
of the parents grew.</p>

<p>A cause is described as: “An antecedent, upon
which an effect follows according to the law of nature.”
(Cent. Dic. 1, p. 868.)</p>

<p>Ordinarily, the word “cause” is understood to
mean a force or agency which produces a given effect
or result, which could not happen without that force
or agency. Such a force or agency is termed an efficient
cause. (Cent. Dic. 3, p. 1849.)</p>

<p>It would be absurd to suppose that the eyes of
the father and mother cause or produce the eyes of
the child. It follows that there is no causative relation
between the eyes of the parents and those of the
child. The most that could be said in this direction is
that the same force or agency which produced the
eyes of the parents, namely: the Creator, also caused
and produced those of the child.</p>

<p>The fact that the father and mother have eyes is
no reason why the child should have them; for the
forces and motions which made the eyes of the parents
ceased to exist long before the formation of the germ-cell
from which the child is produced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Each human eye is a new combination of the
atoms and cells of which it is composed. No atom,
in it, was ever a part of an eye of either parent. The
atoms and cells, of which it is made, are grouped into
new chemical combinations; and these are mechanically
arranged in such a manner as to construct the human
eye for the first and last time. The forces and motions,
which build up each eye are peculiar to it.
The work done in making the eyes of the parents, has
nothing to do with the making of the eyes of the child;
for the atoms and cells which are employed in constructing
the child’s eyes must be assembled and
grouped into the necessary chemical combinations and
mechanical arrangements as if the father and mother
had no eyes. In other words, each eye must be made
anew, without regard to the eyes of the father and
mother or any other person. If a man make a million
bricks, it requires the same work to make the last
one that it did to make the first one; so if a hundred
million silver dollars are coined at a mint it requires,
identically, the same work to coin each of them that it
did to make every other; and so of the eyes.</p>

<p>While discussing “organs of extreme perfection,”
and referring to the imaginary evolution of the human
eye, in his Origin of Species (vol. 1, p. 228), Darwin
says:</p>

<p>“Let this process go on for millions of years, and
during each year on millions of individuals of many
kinds, and may we not believe that a living optical
instrument might be thus formed, as superior to one of
glass as the works of the Creator are to those of man?”</p>

<p>In brief, Darwin’s theory is that the eyes of each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
individual are better than those of his parents; and
that he transmits to his child all the improvements
made on his eyes during his life and so on to the latest
generation. In other words, according to Darwin, the
eyes of today are the “accumulated improvements”
of millions of years.</p>

<p>Apparently Darwin thinks that each individual
gets the benefit of all improvements made in the eyes of
every other individual of all other species without
regard to genetic relations, for he says, “on millions
of individuals of many kinds,” etc. According to this
view, a man would avail himself of any improvement
that might be made in the eye of a fly, which is preposterous.</p>

<p>There would be some force in Darwin’s argument
if it were possible to transfer the father’s or
the mother’s eyes, bodily, to the child. But such a
thing is too absurd to be dreamed of.</p>

<p>Every one knows that each eye, and every part
of it, grows anew, as if the parents of the embryo had
no eyes. Neither Darwin, nor any other man has ever
shown how it is possible for the eyes of the father
or mother to modify or affect the development, growth,
form, size, color, qualities or characteristics of the
child’s eyes. According to Darwin’s theory of “gemmules”
the eyes of the father and mother give off
gemmules which get into his or her blood and thence
into the spermatozoön and the ovum and thence into
the fertilized ovum and these produce eyes, in the
child, like those of its parents. But everybody saw that
these “gemmules” would have great difficulty in finding
the spermatozoön and ovum, and in getting into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
them when found; and that after they reached the
fertilized ovum, which divides into two, four, eight,
sixteen or a million daughter-cells, these gemmules
would have great difficulty in finding the orbit where
the new eye is to grow; and that they were as apt to
land in the back, heel or toe of the embryo as in the
orbit.</p>

<p>Besides, if there were any such thing as Darwin’s
gemmules there would have to be at least one for each
coat, muscle, artery, vein, nerve and part of the eye;
and it would be impossible for them to arrange themselves
in the proper order in the embryo eye. Moreover,
there might be too many or too few gemmules;
some of them might get lost and leave the embryo eye
without one or more of its coats or parts; then the
gemmules from the father’s ayes might clash with
those from the mother’s.</p>

<p>No other man has ever suggested any more plausible
theory, than Darwin’s “gemmules,” of the manner
in which the organs and parts of the parents’
bodies may be supposed to modify and affect those of
the child. But this theory was rejected by every one,
but Darwin, as absurd and impossible.</p>

<p>Every human being begins life as fertilized ovum,
in which there is no eye. No part of the eyes of the
father is transferred, bodily, to those of the child;
nor is any part of the eyes of the mother. Every
part of each eye must be made anew; each part must
have the proper structure, form, and size; must be
adjusted to and correlated with every other; finally,
the several parts must be arranged in the proper order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
in the eye. In other words, two entirely new eyes
must be made for each child.</p>

<p>Either the blind unthinking atoms and cells, of
which the several parts of the eye, namely: the several
coats, the aqueous humor, the lens, the vitreous body,
the optic nerve, the muscles, arteries, veins, nerves,
etc., are built up, do, spontaneously and automatically,
and without the aid of any extraneous, supernatural,
psychic and creative force, assemble and group themselves
into the chemical combinations and mechanical
arrangements necessary to construct the embryo eye;
or the Creator, directly and specially, makes it. Which
hypothesis is most plausible?</p>

complex, and has more parts, than the eye; and every

<h2 id="sec44">Sec. 44. Proposition 11. The Sexual
Organs of Each Individual are New,
Direct and Special Creations</h2>

<p>Every human being begins life as a fertilized
ovum, in which there are no sexual organs whatever.
It follows that a new set of such organs must be made,
out and out, for each individual embryo.</p>

<p>Who or what determines whether the child shall
be a male or female? For several weeks after the
formation of the fertilized ovum there is nothing to
indicate whether the child is to be a boy or girl. If
it is finally decided that it shall be a male, a full set of
male sexual organs is made for him. On the other
hand, if it is to be a female, a set of female organs
is made for her. But the production of male organs
for the one, or female organs for the other is not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
only thing to be done; for every organ and part of the
body is modified, adjusted to and correlated with, the
sexual characters whether male or female. The reader
will readily recall all the distinctive differences between
a man and woman, including the secondary sexual
characters. In other words, if it is determined that
the child shall be a male, every non-sexual organ and
part of his body must be so differentiated and modified
as to make a man of him, in both mind and body.
On the other hand, if the child is to be a female, all
of her non-sexual organs and parts must be so differentiated
and modified as to make a woman of her, with
all of the qualities, characteristics and traits that belong
to woman.</p>

<p>Intellect, memory, will-power, force and motion&mdash;creative
force&mdash;are necessary to convert a sexless embryo
body into a male or female child. This cannot be
done by accident nor by blind chance; nor by the alleged
“factors” of evolution; for this work is done
before the birth of the child and before the “factors”
have had an opportunity to do their “work;” besides,
we cannot believe that the blind “factors” can metamorphose
a sexless embryo into a male or female child.</p>

<p>Neither the father nor the mother has any power
to determine the sex of their child; nor has the fertilized
ovum any such power; for it has no intellect, memory
nor will-power, nor any knowledge of sexual organs
nor of anything else. Moreover, before the sex
of the child has been determined this ovum has been
annihilated by division among a million of daughter-cells,
which are made of animal and vegetable food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
eaten by the mother, which was never a part of any
other human body.</p>

<p>Can we believe that the blind, unthinking atoms
and cells of which the embryo body is built up, do,
spontaneously, automatically and without the aid
of any extraneous psychic force, group themselves into
the chemical combinations and mechanical arrangements,
necessary to construct the sexual organs of a
male or female child? How can these atoms and cells
elect whether it shall be a boy or a girl? If they do
so elect, how can they differentiate and modify all the
non-sexual organs and parts of the body so as to correlate
them with the sexual organs?</p>

<p>The evolutionist and materialist will say that
“heredity” or “nature” determines the sex of the
embryo. I reply that the force and power of “heredity”
and of “nature” are identical with those the
fertilized ovum because they can act, only, by and
through it; and it has no intellect, memory nor will-power
to determine the sex of the child; nor to construct
the male nor the female sexual organs after
electing between them, even if such a thing were possible;
nor any power to correlate the non-sexual organs
and parts, with the male or female sexual organs
so as to produce a man or a woman. In fact
the germ-cell has no knowledge of sexual organs, nor
of their form, size, structure nor functions. It follows
that neither “heredity,” nor “nature” has any
power to determine the sex of the child, nor to correlate
its non-sexual organs with its sexual ones.</p>

<p>We are, therefore, compelled to believe that the
sex of every human being is determined by the Creator;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and that all sexual organs are directly and
specially made by him.</p>

<p>For like reasons, we are compelled to believe that
the heart, lungs, stomach, liver, kidneys, muscles,
arteries, veins, nerves, and other organs and parts of
the body are directly and specially made by the
Creator.</p>

<h2 id="sec46">Sec. 46. Proposition 13. Universal Sameness of
all Human Bodies, is Conclusive Evidence
that Each of Them was Directly and Specially
Made by the Creator</h2>

<p>Every human body that ever lived in any age or
country was composed of identically the same chemical
elements that were or are found in every other
such body, in whatever age or country such other
body may have lived. So, each normal body, in whatever
age or country it may have lived, had the same
chemical combinations; the same mechanical arrangements;
the same structure, the same organs and parts,
and substantially the same form and size, that every
other such body, of the same sex, had, whenever, and
wherever such other body may have lived.</p>

<p>How could this universal sameness of chemical
elements, chemical combinations, mechanical arrangements,
etc., in all human bodies have happened? Could
it have happened by accident or chance; or by force
of the blind factors of evolution; or did the blind,
unthinking atoms and cells, of which each human
body was built up, spontaneously, and automatically,
group themselves into identically the same chemical
combinations, and mechanical arrangements that the
atoms and cells in every other human body had
grouped themselves; thus making chemical elements,
chemical combinations, the mechanical arrangements,
the organs and parts in each human body, identically
the same as those in every other such body, whenever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and wherever it may have lived? Such a thing is impossible;
specially when we consider that each body
grew anew, for itself.</p>

<p>But the evolutionist may say that this universal
sameness in all human bodies is caused by “heredity.”</p>

<p>I reply that each human body begins life as a
fertilized ovum; that it develops and grows anew for
itself, independently of the development and growth
of any other body; it is a new combination of the
atoms and cells&mdash;“organic bricks”&mdash;of which it is
composed; it was made by new forces and motions
of new materials, peculiar to itself. In order to build
each body the atoms and cells, of which it was composed,
must have been selected, assembled at the building
site and there grouped into the necessary chemical
combinations and mechanical arrangement. Intellect,
memory, will-power, force and motion were necessary
to do this work, in each instance.</p>

<p>Heredity is only a name for certain vital phenomena.
It it not a material entity; it has no weight,
length, breadth nor thickness; no constructive force;
no intellect, memory nor will-power; nor any power to
generate force nor motion. Nor has it any power to
assemble the atoms and cells; nor to group and arrange
them in such a manner as to form the body, its
organs and parts. Nor can “heredity” “breathe the
breath of life” into the fertilized ovum nor create a
soul for the embryo body.</p>

<p>“Heredity” does all its work by and through
the fertilized ovum. It has identically the same properties
and potentialities that this ovum has, no more
nor less. Surely this ovum has no knowledge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
bodies of its parents, nor of their organs and parts;
nor can it have any memory of a thing that it never
knew; nor has it any inherent power to reproduce the
bodies of its parents or either of them.</p>

<p>It is impossible to explain and account for this
universal sameness of all human bodies without assuming
that each of them was made by one and the
same hand, namely: Almighty God. We cannot doubt
that He directly and specially created every human
being that ever lived on our planet.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec47">Sec. 47. Proposition 14. Creator’s Supervision
of the Development and Growth of the Embryo
is Necessary to Produce the Human Body</h2>

<p>The watchmaker makes one piece of a watch at
a time; but every organ and part of the embryo body
grows all the time. Thus the body and all its internal
organs and parts; and both arms, hands, legs and feet
are growing continuously until it is grown. If the
growth of each organ and part of the body were not so
regulated as to keep pace with every other organ and
part, there would be no proper proportion among
them. One arm and hand would be larger and longer
than the other; one leg larger and longer than
the other; the five segments in the femur would
not meet and unite to form the complete bone. (Johnson’s
Cyclopedia 7, p. 553.)</p>

<p>If there were no extraneous supervising architect
to adjust and correlate each organ and part to every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
other, there would be no harmony of form, size, nor
structure in the edifice. Surely, the atoms and cells
in the right leg would have no knowledge of the form,
size, nor structure of the left; and no organ, nor any
part of the body, would have any power to adjust
itself, automatically, to any other.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec48">Sec. 48. Proposition 15. Each Human
Body is Specially Endowed with Life</h2>

<p>Neither the spermatozoön nor the ovum is a living
creature, for neither of them has the power to take
and assimilate food; nor to develop and grow, alone.
But when they unite and fuse, this combination begins
to live, it absorbs and assimilates food or nourishment,
develops, divides and produces an infinite number
of daughter-cells. The atoms in the fertilized ovum
are identically the same that were in the spermatozoön
and ovum before the fusion occurred. Perhaps
these atoms form new chemical combinations.
But we cannot believe that any possible combination
of atoms could automatically take on the energies and
phenomena of life. Any good chemist can make the
same combination of atoms that is found in the fertilized
ovum; but his combination would not absorb and
assimilate food, it would not live, develop nor grow.</p>

<p>Life is not a property of matter but something
wholly different from it. Matter may exist without
life; but apparently, life cannot exist without matter.
It is evident that the atoms of which the human body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
is composed did not manifest the phenomena nor the
energies of life until they were grouped into that body;
on the other hand the body does not manifest vital
energies after its death. Life begins at a particular
moment and ceases at another specific instant.</p>

<p>If a piece of iron be charged with electricity, it
will manifest electrical energy so long as it remains
charged. But when the electricity passes from it, the
iron ceases to exhibit such phenomena. So, when the
human body is charged or endowed with life, it
continues to manifest vital phenomena until life passes
out of it.</p>

<p>Life is bestowed on the several species of animal
under divers conditions. Thus, it is bestowed on the
fertilized human ovum in the genital organs of the
mother, for the reason that this is the best, if not the
only, place for it to develop and grow. It is bestowed
on the eggs of fishes in the water; and upon the eggs
of birds, after they have passed out of the bodies of
the mother bird. Let us consider the hen’s egg for a
moment. When laid it contains a fertilized ovum and
“the white and the yellow” of the egg. It is a complete
and finished egg. But it has no life. Unless it
be placed under a sitting hen or in an incubator, it
will decay and disintegrate.</p>

<p>The hen or incubator merely keeps it warm during
the period of incubation. By the end of the
twenty-first day, the contents of the egg-shell have
been converted into a live bird, with a skeleton, muscles,
arteries, veins, nerves, brain, eyes, ears, heart, lungs,
liver, wings, legs, feet, etc. There is no skeleton, model,
nor any other performed outline of the coming chick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
in the egg; for the contents of the egg-shell are a homogeneous
mass of protoplasm. There is no reason to
suppose that the warmth of the hen’s body, nor that
the heat of the incubator, is, alone, adequate to impart
life to the egg. Each part of the egg is necessarily
kept at the same temperature as that of every other
part. For this reason we cannot believe that mere
heat differentiates one part of the white and yellow
into bones, another part into muscles, arteries, veins,
nerves, etc.</p>

<p>In his Principles of Biology, (vol. 1, p. 116),
Spencer says:</p>

<p>“There is experimental proof that seeds may, under
conditions unfavorable to germination, retain for
ten, twenty, and some even thirty years, the
power to germinate when due moisture and warmth
are supplied.”</p>

<p>Now if these seeds are alive, what becomes of the
life in them during these long periods of quiescence?
There are untold millions of grains of wheat and of
corn. None of these grains will germinate until they
are supplied with “moisture and warmth.” Can we
believe that heat and moisture alone have any creative
forces? If so, all the sands of the sea shore ought to
be living creatures.</p>

<p>Let us consider the acorn. When mature, it
falls to the ground. If it be supplied with a proper
degree of heat and moisture, it will germinate in a
short time. But it will never germinate, so long as it
is kept in a cool, dry place. Suppose an acorn is deprived
of heat and moisture for five years; that it
is then supplied with them and immediately germinates.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
When did the life of the acorn begin? Did it
begin when the acorn ripened and dropped to the
ground or when it germinated? If it was alive when
it first matured, and germinated five years afterward,
what became of its life between its maturity and its
germination? Is it not reasonable to suppose that the
Creator endowed it with life when it germinated?</p>

<p>Can we believe that the heat of the mother’s
body is, alone, adequate to generate life in the fertilized
ovum? Can we believe that the heat of the
sun, and the moisture of the earth are, of themselves,
sufficient to generate life in a grain of wheat, a grain
of corn or an acorn?</p>

<p>It follows that the fertilized human ovum must
be directly and specially endowed by the Creator with
the power to absorb and assimilate food, to develop,
grow and live! The Creator in every instance strikes
the vital match!</p>

<h2 id="sec49">Sec. 49. Proposition 16. Every Human
Soul is a New, Direct and Special
Creation</h2>

<p>The soul is defined as: “A substantial entity,
believed to be that, in each person, which lives, feels,
thinks and wills.” (Cent. Dic. 7, p. 5781.)</p>

<p>I hope and believe that every human being has an
immortal soul; and if this be true it must be his or
her own, for we cannot imagine that the same soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
ever occupied more than one body; unless we believe
in the transmigration, metempsychosis or reincarnation
of souls; and this belief is too absurd for serious consideration.
The child does not take his father’s soul
nor his mother’s, nor is there any reason to suppose
that either parent transmits to the child, any part of
his or her soul; nor that either of them transmits any
germ of a new soul for it. No man can even imagine
a division of himself&mdash;his ego or self&mdash;into two or
more parts. It follows that each human body has its
own soul; which is separate from and independent of
every other soul.</p>

<p>We cannot believe that the spermatozoön nor the
ovum has any soul prior to their fusion into the fertilized
ovum. We are therefore compelled to infer
that the soul comes into existence at the moment this
fusion occurs, or shortly afterward. We cannot even
imagine that the soul is created by the father, nor by
the mother, nor by the body in which it resides; nor
by accident nor chance.</p>

<p>It follows that a new soul must be directly and
specially created for each embryo body, if it ever gets
one.</p>

<p>It may be that life is an attribute or property
of the soul. If this be true, the creation of the soul
would include the creation of life.</p>

<p>If one believes that he has a soul, separate and
apart from his body, as most of us do, he is compelled
to assume, that it was directly and specially
created by Almighty God.</p>

<p>If we believe that the soul is a special creation, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
may well assume that the body is also a special creation.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="sec50">Sec. 50. Objection to this Theory of Special
Creation</h2>

<p>I admit that there are serious objections to my
theory of special creation. But like objections may
be brought against any other theory. For example,
many serious objections have been brought against
Darwin’s theory of organic evolution. Yet a majority
of all the scientists believe it is true.</p>

<p>In his “Man’s Place in Nature” (p. 149), Huxley
says:</p>

<p>“Our acceptance of the Darwinian hypothesis
must be provisional so long as one link in the chain of
evidence is wanting: and so long as all animals and
plants certainly produced by selective breeding from
a common stock are fertile, and their progeny are fertile
with one another, that link will be wanting.”</p>

<p>This link is still missing and probably will be
forever.</p>

<p>Although there are serious objections to my theory,
yet there is none so serious as there are to the
alternative theory that dead atoms and blind, unthinking
cells do spontaneously and automatically group
themselves into the chemical combinations and mechanical
arrangements, which are necessary to produce
the human body; and that this body becomes, spontaneously
and automatically, a live human being with
intellect, memory and will.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
